I did not find a lot of the editing issues that others mentioned, so it's likely that a new edition has been released with many of those errors corrected.This was a kindle freebie, but I definitely think it's worth the 1.50 that it's currently for sale for on amazon. The author paints a very interesting world, both below and above. The world below is split up into different factions and in some ways strikes me as very 'mad max'. It's nothing particularly new or innovating, but the author makes the characters more than interesting enough to engross the reader.Upstairs is Haven, the fancy place where all the citizens live. We don't get to see a lot of this, only glimpses through the few characters we follow around. Most of them are not particularly interesting, a stark contrast with the characters below. Most of them are a bit cliche, but that changes as the storyline moves along.Overall it's worth a read, and I'm going to be picking up the next one.","05 7, 2013",A1C6S2CE7DNQBE,Amazon Customer,Interesting characters in an absorbing dystopian world,1367884800

I was excited about this book.I read it cover to cover so to speak .. in about 35 minutes.Bleh.Being the second book in the Jane Porter series, this picked up right where the first left off.Jane is a woman who was celibate for 2 years.  Apparently she is ""insatiable"" .. at least until Antonio awakened her desires.  In this book, their passionate D/s relationship has been enhanced by Santos, Antonio's best friend.  Yadda yadda ..It is one thing to write a series.  It is one thing to write a series of short novels.  It is a completely different thing to write a book that contains only a few scenes; most of which by the way, were your normal Joe Blow.  Seriously?I love this story.  I look forward to reading more.  The next book in this series, Reinventing Jane Porter is now on my kindle awaiting my attention.  I'm pretty bummed though.I like this author a lot, but if I can only look forward to 30 minute stories that cost $2-$4 ..

An easy read as Robyn and Keil find each other and make themselves a life together. It is short, but it's also part of a series. You see, while it technically stands alone, it comes to a rather abrupt ending. We get a whole lot of World Definition, some hot sex, a return to civilisation, and then it ends. But that ending is picked up during the next book, so we see how Robyn and Keil are getting on, from a slightly different perspective. An interesting technique which will polarise readers, but works for me. (And since Arend also published the two books in paperback, possibly indicative of a greater plan).

5120,9631,B0030F2S70,"[1, 1]",4,"I nearly didn't buy this book because at least two reviewers said the heroine was annoying. One quoted the heroine saying the room felt ""embarrassed"" because of a minor imperfection in the flooring. I thought that sounded quirky and since I'm known to be a little quirky myself, I decided to give the book a try. I'm glad I did.The story is well-written and entertaining. For the first time in a romance story I got irritated by the make-out/sex scenes because they were interrupting the story and I wanted to see what would happen next! Even though it was quite obvious to me who the villain was, I still wanted to know how the person would be discovered and what the consequences would be. I was a little impatient with the characters--especially Ellis--for being unable to guess the person's identity, but I guess Ellis has a blind spot as she likes to believe the best of others.The unmasking of the villain turned out to be a bit of an anti-climax, though. When incidents escalate, the police are called in, but we are never clued into what is going on with the investigation. One day the police are interviewing our hero and heroine, then a week or so later, the police turn up and arrest the villian and cart the person off the premises. We are not even allowed a glimpse of the arrest scene, so there just didn't seem to be a strong enough resolution to the whole mystery, even though we know who did it and why it was done.As for the romance between Simon and Ellis, it was satisfying to me. I thought she was a little eccentric where her work was concerned, and a bit of a perfectionist, but not unreasonably demanding. Simon's a hard-working guy who takes pride in the work his company does, and he recognises that same element in Ellie. So, while he may get exasperated with Ellie's requests, he doesn't hold them against her. The two of them fit together quite well. I thought the author was going to get Simon to meet Ellis' family, since Ellis' mother was mentioned, but that didn't happen. A pity, because it would have been great to see them get together outside, away from the whole construction/interior decorator setting. I do agree with another reviewer that Simon shouldn't have flirted with Cynthia but I think he wasn't sure how to extricate himself from her when she cornered him--and being that I'm a woman and I've seen how some women can be, I can find it in myself to feel a little sorry for the poor guy!Overall, I liked the story a lot and I would read other works by this author.","10 18, 2012",AMTSK84YW69GR,ireneQ,Fun,1350518400

Secondly, I dislike the author's fascination with the juvenile use of sex in this story; I mean really...two jerk (blank) sessions in one very short story accompanied by ongoing graphic references concerning semen and its various characteristics are a little much, don't you think??? There is the obligatory gore which seems to pervade this genre and, while some authors handle it well, this author overwrites his descriptive prose horribly. In addition, errors and omissions don't help garner higher ratings. Oh well, live and learn...perhaps the best tact for me is to simply stop giving this author other chances for redemption.

She took her time to decide that she wasn't ready to commit to marriage to her beau in Arizona and decided to give up a good job that she'd held for 16 years and move back to where her roots are in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina.  I also chose this book because I've been all through the Blue Ridge Parkway many times and it brought back nice memories of such beauty.Once Rachel gets about halfway settled in, her friend Isaac comes over to ask a favor of her.  A friend of his died by falling over a cliff to his death below, but police have ruled it either suicide or an accident, but Isaac knows in his heart it was neither.  He wants Rachel to do her own little investigation of this incident.  In between getting her house ready, her gardens done with the help of a landscaper, buying a new car, and meetings for her work, she manages to interview a lot of people who could be connected to Isaac's friend's death.  Some of them certainly have good motives, or at least it seems that way.One of the things I loved best about this book is the gardening and the discussions of the different kinds of flowers and plants that Rachel has.  I could just smell the lemon verbena (which is so hard to control!) and was amazed at the different kinds of hosta. Rachel is someone I could easily be friends with, and she would make a great conversationalist and just an all around fun friend.  There is humor in the book, tension, suspense and romance.  Her new suitor hopefully works out, as well as her new job.I intend to download as many as I can of these mysteries.  With cozy mysteries like this one, there is always something new to learn.

This story is based in Denver, and the couple focus is on Nick West and Holly North.My TakeThis is about the West branch of the McKay family and fits in about where Cam has been back from Iraq for ten months, four months in Sundance; Colt has been sober two years now and moving out of the Boar&#8217;s Nest. Cam bought him and Buck out.It's cute enough, too cute really---it does make a sweet Christmas tale. And I was impressed that the shy Holly North should come out with that comment about how &#34;not all women mount up the same or crave that type of wild ride&#34;.

And ain&#8217;t that a twist? It was fun, but it didn&#8217;t make it ring quite true---not enough of a twist. The story tried, it definitely tried but it was too cute and too pat.

She buys an antique mirror with strange symbols on it and learns it is not all it appears to be, it leads her to the man of her dreams. Silas is a Scottish wolf shifter who spies Martha and recognizing her as his mate he convinces her to stay with him, then proceeds to capture her heart.The author writes a decent sentence the storyline is cohesive and the dialogue smooth. The steamy scenes were abundant, detailed, and sizzling, but I had some major problems with this book.First, I really don't like when a book goes from zero to one hundred in the first few pages. Martha and Silas were having sex before you even knew anything about their personalities or could form any kind of emotional attachment. Silas remains pretty two dimensional throughout. There was no build up, no flirting, no draw to help you feel the chemistry between them it was disappointing, and there were so many steamy scenes in the beginning that I started skipping through to get to the meat of the story.Second, Silas is described as the usual alpha male big, buff, and bad, most women's ideal fantasy man. Then Martha is described and she is plain and over weight.....now just hear me out. I understand that we all come in different shapes and sizes I am not perfect either but this is fantasy, so when I read I am visualizing the scene as the author describes it, why would I want to fantasize about a beautiful man having sex with an over weight unattractive woman. I want to leave the reality outside of my books, authors never design the lead man as scrawny, plain, and timid....that's because women wouldn't like it. I get that she is trying to appeal to the audience by saying here is a hot guy going for the everyday women, but throughout the book Martha is describing herself, an introvert with plain looks, hair, and an over weight figure and coming to terms with the fact that Silas doesn't care, but to me it disturbs the romance of the book....it's a turn off. I felt as though Martha really didn't like herself, so guess what I had a hard time liking her as well. If you are going to have a character described as less than ideal I would accept it much better if she were confident with what she has, not insecure. Make her big, sassy, and proud.Lastly, there really wasn't much to the book other than steamy scenes and that became tiresome if you took those out it would be a very short novella, so if you want an unemotional erotic romance then this book is for you. This is my first read by this author so maybe her other books are different, better? I got this for free and would be hard pressed to purchase any of her other books or continue this series.

The first chapter takes place at work and Lena literally doesn't work for the rest of the book.  The world of work presented here isn't realistic either.  It just doesn't make sense that five college friends, all in their twenties, would be able to set up a super successful Hollywood production company - especially when they rely on their receptionist to set up meetings for them and he does it on the basis of whether or not the guys are cute.  This is far from a minor detail in the book - Lena's job is supposedly how she meets the male main character in the first place.It was disturbing how quickly Lena adopted Luke as a ""pet,"" buying him clothes, telling people to keep their hands off of him, being charmed by his failure to understand human society (and while we're at it, why bother to create a whole new class of beings for your books but then stick with the whole ""he doesn't really understand humans/good sex mates him for life/he is violently possessive"" thing that plagues most PNRs?), and telling her friends (in front of him!) very specific details about how good he is in bed.  I'm so sick of the message that all every woman of minimal accomplishment wants is a guy who will be willing to have slightly deviant sex with her while being so turned on by her that he'll feel compelled to rape her when he even imagines her with another man (which, yes, actually happens here).  While this might not work with an actual woman, Lena is a bit more one-dimensional.  She's sassy!  She's been hurt by men!  She's always on a diet!  She likes mochas!  Her living room is decorated with high heeled shoes and knick knacks from Anthropologie!  She's presumably JUST LIKE YOU or JUST LIKE YOU WOULD WANT TO BE, all she needs is a monster to make her complete (and maybe rape her on the couch!)The plot doesn't really exist other than the sex - there's a flimsy and easily resolved conflict and the rest of the time is spent setting up Lena's beautiful and super cool friends to star in future books.  They're women of accomplishment also, so it should be no time before they realize that their entire life was worthless until they met a macho monster to dominate them.","07 20, 2011",A3A7FF87LEVCQ1,morehumanthanhuman,Boring,1311120000

Demetria is a plant wizard with the ability to control and speak to plant life, which does tend to make them grow very well.  Her husband, Ward, is a dungeon master who can control stone.All of the inhabitants of Sage have some type of magical affinity, whether to plants, stone, animals, and a variety of other talents.The Rats who live in a neighboring kingdom, however, are not amiable with the humans of Sage.  Therein lies much of the conflict in these stories. In the first tale, the Rats have sent a plague of rotten mold into Sage.  Who better to fight this menace than Demetria, the master gardener? With great personal sacrifice, Demetria, assisted by other wizards, fights off the slime threatening her land.In the second story, Demetria and Ward must rescue their son from the Rat Kingdom. They get some surprising help from those believed to be the guilty parties.Okay, I'm writing this review before I've read the third tale, however, I will absolutely do so and know I will enjoy the heck out of it.  I've become a Demetria fan.  I look forward to seeing more tales from the land of Sage.  But, Maria, let's get this book in print so I can take it to bed with me.  Now, that's where I can read for enjoyment.One last note for Maria: Fifty-five is NOT old!","09 21, 2009",A26DMTLIKAT8DN,"Marva Dasef ""YA Fantasy Author""",Nothing like a bit of sage...,1253491200

She can't deny that seeing Nic and Leo in class every day has been a pleasure.  They're certainly the stars of many of her more erotic fantasies but they're students and therefore off limits.Nic Potter and Leo Phelps only enrolled in Briony's class so that they could get closer to her.  Neither of them needs the credit for her class in order to graduate and they feel it's time to make their true intentions toward Briony known.  They've seen her watching them and are aware that her desire for them is as strong as theirs is for her but there are ethics involved and convincing her to give them a chance is going to be more complicated than they initially thought.Nic and Leo's feelings for Briony go beyond sexual desire.  They honestly want to build a future with her.  However, their initial approach and suggestion that they have dinner together doesn't go over so well - especially once Nic blurts out the full extent of their sexual plans for her.  Briony's intelligent enough to know that the classroom is her safe haven and any non-academic involvement with Nic and Leo will be frowned upon.  That doesn't stop her from fanaticizing about them though.  Be that as it may, it's only a matter of time before she caves in to her own desires and takes Nic and Leo to her bed.  Just when it looks like they could possibly have a future together disaster strikes and their secret rendezvous are discovered.  Faced with the choice of career or her men Briony has some heavy decisions to make.Brynn Paulin's TWO PLUS ONE dives headfirst into the quandary of ethics versus desire.  Briony's a wonderful teacher who has always toed the line when it comes to her career.  Nic and Leo initially appear to be nothing more than college students hell bent on bedding the teacher but as you'll discover there's much more to them than meets the eye.  What I love about this story is watching Briony grow from a jittery unsure woman to one who stands up for herself and what she believes to be right.  Her disability and her career has been a crutch for her for so long that she's lost sight of what could truly make her happy so it brought a smile to my face to imagine Nic and Leo's determination to make her see herself the way they see her.  TWO PLUS ONE is one hot story full of steamy sex, raw sensuality and lots of little surprises as this trio works toward finding a way to build a future together.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","01 20, 2011",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

6733,6766,B002NOGFHS,"[2, 2]",3,"Warning: This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating: 6/10PROS:- There's a lot at the beginning of the story that I found intriguing: the avoidance early on of any direct references to ""werewolves"" or ""mates,"" Nate's reactions toward various people touching him, and his muteness (see cons also). The little hints here and there pertaining to Nate's background and what he's running from are revealed slowly in a way that really piqued my curiosity.- Joe, typical werewolf that he is, is incredibly protective and possessive of Nate, and these are traits I respond to every time I read about them, especially if the recipient of the protectiveness has never been cherished before. I really liked the scene in which Joe takes the time and effort to educate Nate extensively on what werewolf mating entails. Nate has a decent idea of what he's getting himself into before Joe claims him, even if Joe does conveniently forget a few things.- There's a good deal of sex in the story (it's light on plot, but it makes up for that with sex scenes), and for once there's a story element that allowed me to believe that one character could really climax twice within the span of 5 minutes EVERY time.CONS:- The language throughout is simplistic. (There's one page that contains the word ""quickly"" in 5 different sentences: quickly pulled, quickly lifted, quickly had them undone, quickly humped, quickly licked his finger...and there are 2 ""slowly""s in there, too.) In addition, the writing contains mistakes that make it seem pretty amateurish at times: isolated POV switches within scenes; needless repetition; a lot of focus on mundane descriptions; too many ""he""s without identifying which character they refer to (""He caught up with him just as he reached his motorbike""); etc.- A lot of the transitions in the book seemed rushed and/or poorly developed to me. The revelation of the men's desire for each other, for example, occurs suddenly with almost no buildup in preceding scenes. And Nate's transition from silent to chatty is the same way. He's entirely mute for the first several chapters, and then when he does first speak, it's not like he starts with one- and two-word answers and then gradually works his way up. He just launches into full-blown conversation mode.- Nate is basically just a stereotypical romance heroine with male anatomy. He's timid and tiny (as in, Joe and Nate are eye-to-eye when Joe is kneeling) and is expected to stay home and cook and clean like the proverbial Little Woman. The author does include a few little indications that such treatment bothers Nate (""it still rankled a bit""), but the two men's roles within the relationship seemed extreme to me.Overall comments: I didn't find this story quite as melodramatic as other Stormy Glenn stories I've read (although this one does contain its fair share of epic misunderstandings--at one point, Joe does something that hurts Nate's feelings and Nate thinks of 10 possible reasons for Joe's reaction but never even considers the most obvious one). My main complaint with the book is that the writing is far from the best I've read: it's plagued by sloppy phrasing and poor (if any) editing throughout. Writing issues aside, though, this is still a fun, frothy little story.","11 10, 2010",A3O9A7B0KJO88B,Charly T. Anchor,"Feel-good story, but not the best writing",1289347200

Brandon really has nothing to offer in this relationship.Also, once Nick and Brandon actually meet face to face and fall in love at first sight, so many bad things happen to them all within a week or two, it's unbelievable.The story is told in flashbacks, switching from the present to the past, and while in the present, they also talk a bit about what happened in the ""middle."" It's the little snippets about the middle part of the story that frustrated me. I guess reading pieces of 3 different time periods is just not my cup of tea.It's still a good read, when I want to suspend my disbelief and experience an emotional story about a star-crossed kind of relationship where everything is stacked against them, and they try to overcome it. But I'd give it 5 stars if my disbelief were easily suspended by the story, without so much effort.","01 11, 2012",A2PXDVKKE8TFZV,BAGS,Reading it for the second time-possible spoilers,1326240000

Second, Two accepted that she was a vampire far too quickly - I didn't buy that either.  The main problem I had with this book was the lack of emotional depth.

I just couldn't get over the fact that the relationship didn't seem real to me.  I wish I could have because I think the direction this writer was going in as far as vampire lore was fascinating.

Just when she thought she could have no future, she was shown dreams were still possible, and sometimes they actually came true.  Bethany grew up with Jacob as a surrogate father.  She was one of the most successful photographers for his men's magazine, but there was still one secret dream that she didn't believe possible.  She didn't want to disappoint Jacob, but she couldn't help being attracted to his son, Derrick, and his best friend Nathan Hall.  Many of her nights were spent wondering what it would be like to be shared by the men that were known to share everything.Derrick didn't approve of his father's lifestyle, and had vowed years before to never get involved with the girls his father brought home, but he had been struggling with his decision since Bethany moved in.  Nathan had been ready to start something with her for some time, but Derrick was hesitant.  He knew it was just a matter of time because he was already struggling with his desire for her, and it was approaching out of control status.This is a terrific read!  I am a fan of TAM, and enjoyed this latest book as well.  I will add it to the list of her books that are keepers!  Bethany is such a complex character that has lived through some horrific circumstances.  You just want the best for her, and that comes in the form of both Derrick and Nathan.

It reminds me of those lurid (meant in a good way!) covers on old horror stories which I love and miss with today's generic appearance of most books. The plot summary sealed the deal: I had to read this one!Three different story-lines are intricately woven into a compelling story: a clan of vampire-like beings called longclaws living in a parallel, prehistoric-like world, hunting for fresh blood and hiding from other, even more menacing creatures. An ancient Indian tribe knowing about the dangerous otherworldly beasts and closing the energy lines leading to their world. A teenage runaway boy ending up with his old great-uncle who lives to protect humanity by guarding the portal.Then one longclaw discovers a way to cross the border into paradise: our human world, where they are superior predators among easy prey. A brutal fight for survival begins - on both sides.The author uses different time lines, parallel worlds and different points of view, sometimes retelling a scene as experienced from both humans and longclaws. Where other books get lost in their overwhelming, confusing complexity, that is never the case with longclaws, where all parts converge into a coherent and unique whole.The underlying premise that our folklore especially about vampires and werewolves stems from encounters with creatures from another dimension mark Longclaws as an outstanding work in the 'fangs&claws;' genre. However, this distinctive novel will surely appeal to fans of all types of horror.(I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review)","04 10, 2013",A39K0X3OH4SSZL,misspider,Wow!,1365552000

We're just told his grey hair indicates he is older than fifty) receives a letter from an old flame.  They were actually engaged at one point, but the engagement ended.  Why?  We're told he never knew why.Okay.  Maybe those questions will be answered in the manuscript that his ex encloses.Nope.  It's a totally different story, starting at her childhood and then skipping forward to middle-age.  There's a little too much detail at the beginning (for example:  her material grandparents didn't want her parents to get married, telling her to stay away from ""Polls"" [sic]), as if Patterson initially set out to write a longer story and then lost his resolve.  So after setting the scene, we're skipped ahead decades.The plot itself, we're told, is based on a true story.  It's one of those things that you might hear of happening to a friend of a friend of a friend -- a woman smells roses if somebody in her family is about to die.  But this wasn't enough and we get two other supernatural elements that are played out in great detail and then never explained.It's less thrilling than it is sophoric.

It was sexy in a desperate kind of way, but felt incomplete.PLOT & CHARACTERS: Not really much plot and the story was so short that pacing was irrelevant. Mostly this was just incomplete. It read like a vignette, not a story. The characters were undeveloped, though the man was intriguing. It might have been fun to get to know him better through a longer story.BOTTOM LINE: This story is one word: HARMLESS.

Hero's mom announces that she has dreamed of his bride and where to find her.  Hero is not very happy to hear that his days of bachelorhood are numbered which is very amusing to his two brothers.  He drags his feet before finally being forced by hunger to seek her out.  Because he has waited so long, he is overly hungry and stupidly frightens his future bride into calling the police on him.  Wait it gets worse.  Well I will let you find out how things work out but really I kept reading but I'm not sure if I enjoyed it.  If you like to read stories about ""true"" love where the hero and heroine hate and avoid each other and can't stay away from each other, here ya are.  I did not like that the heroine fought so hard to not want him.  All works out in the end of course, you knew that right?  But I seemed to finish reading it in spite of the couple not being very appealing to me.  So I would rate this as a good read with some reservation.

It is magnificent and captivating, and it's apparent from the first chapter that Edgar Rice Burroughs is a genius. This is a wonderful story filled with his spectacular thoughts and imagination. Original, epic, and enthralling, I was unable to put it down and am chomping at the bit to read the next four books in the collection. A true master of the sci/fi adventure genre on par with Vance and Wells......""The Gods of Mars"" by Edgar Rice Burroughs. The hectic, chaotic, frenetic, pace continues as John Carter, his son Carthoris, and Tars Tarkas take on the Issus and the ""the blacks"" to rescue Dejah Thoris (Princess of Helium). Massive battles and unrelenting treachery and deceit continues to fuel the fusilade of destruction on the enemy air fleets. Pulp sci/fi adventure at its best makes this one of the most entertaining stories of all time from the pen of a master storyteller......""The Warlord of Mars"" saga and action continues unabated in the third book in the Barsoom Series and it's fantastic! Almost constant conflict confronts John Carter, Prince of Helium, as he fights for the release of his beloved Dejah Thoris. The budding love between their son Carthoris and Thuvia of Ptarth brings joy to both houses. Edge of your seat battles against the Lord of the Thenes, Matai Shang, and his minion Thurid will keep you awake at nights as the Jed's come together and unite under the Jedakk of Jedakaks, the Warlord of Barsoom!......""Thuvia, Maid of Mars""carries on and expands this epic collection of stories. Book IV of the series shifts the focus away from John Carter to his son Carthoris and Thuvia, the love of his life. Enduring many hardships and death defying battles and contraptions Carthoris rescues Thuvia and receives the blessing from Kulan Tith, her designated husband, to marry her in his stead. Although a bit repetitive with events/confrontations similar to the previous books this is never-the-less a thrilling roller coaster ride that will exhilarate and enthrall you throughout...onward to the V and final book in the collection......""The Chessmen of Mars"" is my least favorite book in ""The Barsoom Series."" I loved the pacing and one of the most original and imaginative creature/humanoid/ creations in all of science fiction ""Ghek the Kaldane from Bantoom."" Kaldane's are unquestionably one of the most unusual, unique, creepy, entertaining yet unsettling, beings ever conjured by an inditer in the sci/fi genre...a simply wonderful and amazing creature! Once again the story shifts from Carthoris and Thuvia to the new heroine ""Tara, Princess of Helium"" and her suitor """"Gahan, Jeddak of Gatholian."" I love this series in spite of its predictability and occasional redundancy. A true classic with A movie in the works!","09 23, 2011",A2QYBDHVVSSGU4,"Dave H ""Dave H""",Dave H,1316736000

Or, if you do have the Insider's Guide you already have this story and don't need to repurchase.As can be told by the product description it gives more detail about Zsadist and Bella--the main characters from the third novelLover Awakened (Black Dagger Brotherhood, Book 3)If you have not yet read any of the BDB series, this is NOT the place to start, you should really start withDark Lover (Black Dagger Brotherhood, Book 1).  Following the way many paranormal romance series are published, each title in the series features a main character who happens to find his/her fated love.  With a lot of angst and hot/detailed nookie involved to make it interesting.  That said, this series is fabulous in that aspect--JR Ward does a great job with her world building and each story continues an overall plot arc.  Each tale is also good at keeping tabs on favorites from other books.  Because there is a lot of story arc going on it is pretty important to keep going in order.This novella was not integral to the story told in Lover Awakened, but clearly more Z/B was needed.

10325,6339,B002K2RSSS,"[1, 1]",3,"This Kindle version of Ernest Bramah's Max Carrados stories is a collection of stories originally published in pulp magazines rather than a digital version of a previously published book.  The collection covers the time period of 1914 (the first Max Carrados story, ""The Coin of Dionysius"") through the WWI years into the 1920s.  Very few Carrados mysteries are ""murder mysteries"" but are more likely to deal with fraud, theft and (in the war years) espionage.Although Carrados first appeared as the Sherlock Holmes stories were ending and seven years before the first Lord Peter Wimsey story was published, his stories have a distinct resemblance to both.  The blind detective has Holmesian powers of observation but a more affable personality and affluent lifestyle similar to Wimsey.Modern mystery readers may have some trouble adapting to Bramah's style particularly in the earliest stories.  Even with the Holmes stories, we are accustomed to a detailed exposition of the mystery and some kind of resolution for the characters (i.e., ""the boy and girl got married and had three children"", ""the murderer was tried and executed""). The early Carrados stories just stop.  Yes, the solution is revealed along with Carrados's observations but it can be a bit obscure particularly since modern readers won't be familiar with many aspects of daily life in the early 20th century. It took me awhile to understand ""The Ghost of Massingham Mansions"" since I am not familiar with the lighting or plumbing in use in 1890's apartment buildings.  But it was actually a very effective and touching way to end ""The Ingenious Mr. Spinola"".  Later stories are noticeably different as some do have more detailed endings.This would have been a pleasant enough read if not for a major failure in kindle formatting.  Although the first few and last stories are well formatted, the middle is difficult.  All sense of paragraphing and quotation marks are lost so that it is sometimes hard to tell who is speaking to whom and if it is a character speaking at all.  One later story suddenly appears at the end of another with no chapter break (and then appears again as its chapter in the table of contents).","02 8, 2014",A22UILFTP4Y4C2,"JZS ""JZS""",If Conan Doyle and Dorothy Sayers had a child it would be Max Carrados,1391817600

Her father is left in a coma as a result. Not having much money, and knowing she will have substantial medical bills in the near future for her father, she decides to sell Steward House to Grant Wolverton. She has had a crush on Grant since childhood, but he doesn't remember her. Very wealthy, Grant who deals in antiques and art, offers to restore Steward House, and Delia reluctantly hands over the deed for a great sum of money.Delia herself is a stone conservator - but that is not where her special abilities end. She can also communicate with the stone statues. They keep her company but they have also made her the town outcast. Stories have been swirling about her odd behavior in the small town she is from. Now that she is back in that small town, gossip starts again. Afraid to let Steward House go completely, she offers to take over the remodel. Grant agrees - and neither can quite let go of the attraction that is building between them. But the question of who set the fire is still unsolved and there is another woman in town who has her eyes set on Steward House and Grant.Stone Kissed is an odd little book. I say that because it is different - and I really wanted to like it. But I had some problems. It starts off rough and the first third of the book I had a really hard time with. The sentences and changes from scene to scene were jerky and not smooth. I didn't understand Grant and had a hard time with the intense attraction Delia feels for him. About halfway through things start to settle down and I became more immersed in the story. It is a dark book. Delia has an awful relationship with her father who is now comatose so she has guilt in that area. She had to give up her home which she feels a great connection to, and she has to figure out these intense feelings for Grant. I had a hard time buying into the romance. The actual sex scenes are very sensual, but I didn't get Grant's love for Delia. Delia herself has had a crush on Grant for years, so her side makes more sense. But for most of the book, Grant thinks Delia is delusional for her claim to talk to statues and he thinks she is a thief for taking his statues from him. Yet he still falls in love? I buy into the fact he lusted after her and likes her in his bed, but not love.I liked the statue aspect and how they interacted with Delia. I also think the villain in this story is well done - nothing is held back in terms of the evil emanating from her. But the overall tone of the book is so dark and depressing. I tend to like darker books, but there wasn't anything to grasp onto as we waded through the serious stuff. I never quite understood Delia and Grant. And when I don't believe in the love between the hero and heroine, I can't be satisfied by the story.","12 28, 2010",A1W5WDICY81WQ3,"A.

If you don't mind uncomfortable settings (war) and circumstances (widowhood, capture & pursuit by the enemy) and relationships that seem destined to go nowhere (regrettable class barriers), then you might enjoy this. It started off nicely, but got steadily gloomier. At about 70%, I gave it up altogether - while it might have had a satisfying ending, by that point I was too discouraged to care.Other reviewers have commented on the similarities to Carla Kelly, but I was disappointed to find the wartime setting was the only thing the novels shared. I absolutely loved Carla Kelly's Marrying the Captain, Royal Marine and Surgeon series. They were gritty portrayals of war as secondary to the romance - yet the romances were heart-warming, uplifting and somehow full of hope. I don't mind angst and tension, but I must feel hopeful. I read for pleasure and this book just struck me as too gloomy. The hero and heroine seemed too willing to accept that they had no future together. Their relationship always focused on imminent separation, so they didn't fully enjoy the present.Just wasn't the book for me, I'm sorry to say. I'm sorry because I would have loved to have found another author who can offer such heartwarming stories as Kelly. The many excellent reviews of this book led me to expect a very different read, and I do hope if you buy this book you will have the experience others have had, and not what I found.","05 30, 2013",A2YX1QL07CL7B8,Linda Jean,Vaguely Depressing,1369872000

1236,2170,B001DOHZ5A,"[2, 2]",4,"Reviewed by ANN & posted at Under the Covers Book BlogBORDER LAIR is the second book in the Dragon Knights series. While I do believe that this book is strong as a standalone, Adora and Jared are introduced in MAIDEN FLIGHT and their romance really stems from there. This book takes on a different approach than the first book. I thought D'Arc really changed the tone of the series with this one. Things are far more bigger in this book - war is approaching and dark times are ahead.Unfortunately for Jared, his life has been in constant darkness since his wife and child died. His grief still lingers within him and he feels unworthy of Adora's love even though she is willing to give it freely. He deems himself undeserving and I think readers will be touched by Jared's gentle heart. Adora gentle coxes Jared out of his shell and slowly learns his ways. As their romance continues to bloom D'Arc really cements the fact that they are meant to be together, a third member is introduced. Lord Darian comes to warn them that death and destruction come their way and though he is seen as a traitor now, Jared welcomes his old friend. Darian takes an immediate interest in Adora and sparks fly between the two. However, as Darian is a member of the royal line of black dragons, Adora is aware that she cannot have something permanent with Darian even though she desperately wants to.D'Arc experiments with the mating rules and rituals she introduced in the first book and I liked seeing the happy ending at the end, but felt that the solution to the conflict seemed to happen too conveniently. I also felt that the romance was slightly impeded by Jared's hesitancy and seemed to fast-track too quickly after when he made the decision to be with Adora to make up for the time lost. Nevertheless, I was enraptured by D'Arc's world. Bringing together dragons, war and love, D'Arc is readily able to transport readers to another time, giving them an escape that they will sure to remember.The se x scenes, again, are very explicit but are well-done. D'Arc explores light bondage and m&eacute;na ge well and am always looking forward to seeing how she will bring three different people together for the purpose of love. She seems to do a stellar job each time.*ARC provided by publisher","09 25, 2012",A1JKGTL51HHTU1,Under The Covers Book Blog,explicit but are well-done.,1348531200

She yearns to raise her daughter in the small town in which she was raised.  The only problem? Hayden and Chandler Scott still live there and if the looks Lizzy is getting from the people about town mean anything, then she has been claimed by the two men who broke her heart years ago.Dakota Springs starts out with a bang.

1296,3069,B001S2RLX8,"[1, 1]",3,"When her boyfriend calls at the last minute and blows off the vacation she was so looking forward to, Cassandra Devon quickly reevaluates both the relationship and her plans. She dumps the boyfriend, packs her bags, grabs a bunch of the classic books she loves - wildly adventurous and swashbuckling romances that never fail to sweep her away from her average life - and heads to San Diego to meet up with her best friend Valerie. Nothing would please her more than to spend a couple of weeks of fun, friendship, and relaxation. And, of course, reading. Lots and lots of reading.When she gets off the plane and hooks up with Valerie, she comes face to face with the ruggedly handsome but perfectly annoying Connor, the best friend and business partner of Val's cousin Raphael. He's everything Cassandra would never go for in a man. Raphael, on the other hand, is just what she's looking for. He's all things swarthy and genteel, and so gorgeous he looks like he just stepped off the cover of one of her beloved bodice rippers. And she's thrilled when Raphael seems to be equally interested in her.In fact, Cassandra would be contentedly planning her HEA with Raphael if it wasn't for the odious Connor. Not only is he rude, he's got boundary issues - the sort that have him waltzing into her room when she's in the bath, then not having the decency to respect her privacy when she gets out. Then he's all with the kissing and sparring, challenging her at every turn, getting her blood up. The fiend.The longer her vacation continues, the more Connor gets under her skin, until she's practically spitting at him every time he shows up...which is all the time. Problem is, all that conflict has Cassandra questioning her own preferences. Could it be that the hero-type she thought she wanted can't hold a candle to the bad boy she can't help but need? Or is Cassandra's HEA destined to never escape the pages of a book?~*~After the past couple of books I've read left me yearning for some romantic comedy, I needed Lavey'sRipping the Bodiceto cleanse my reading palate and lighten my spirits. It was partially successful in that it's a relatively harmless and humorous romance that made me chuckle out loud in a few places, but it didn't appeal quite as much as I was hoping. I can't say the fault lies with the story, exactly. It's just, as I was reading, I realized I'm not a big fan of bodice rippers. That was a problem because I had a hard time relating to the character who seemed to turn nearly every moment of her life into a scene from one.Instead of being amused by the tongue-in-cheek, exaggerated fantasy life of Cassandra, I was overwhelmed by the number of times the book slipped into italics and flounced around with long scenes of purple prose and over-indulgent scenarios. A few here and there with much shorter length would have been sufficient to make the point and keep the pace of the contemporary romance development from floundering. Not to mention that the scenes took page space from the much-needed character definition and plot development. As a result, too much of the book failed to dip beneath surface issues and conflicts and remained two-dimensional.That was a shame, because there really wasn't anything wrong with what was there outside of Cassandra's dream world. The characters were likable, Cassandra was quirky with a hint of snarky steel that I enjoyed, and there was genuine chemistry between Connor and Cassandra from early into the book. I can't ask for too much more than that. But that's exactly what I feel I got...too much more than that.I didn't mind the predictability of the plot. I wasn't expecting any new ground in romance fiction to be laid with the book so the fact that a reader can see the end coming from a fair distance away didn't bother me. The irony is that the parts of the book that went awry for me were the unexpected parts; the dream sequences, if you will, that didn't appeal. By the end of the book it felt like I'd skimmed a good half of its content to avoid the escalating fiction-within-fiction scenes. As a general rule, that's not a good way to feel satisfactorily entertained.~*~*~*~Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.","09 28, 2011",A2E9HDZXQORZLA,"Tracy ""One Good Book Deserves Another""",Kept Picturing Raphael as Fabio - Scary,1317168000

4559,1414,B0016IXMCI,"[8, 8]",5,"Under advisement of her editor, romance author Julia Martin is about to embark on a new venture - writing erotic romances.  Unfortunately she doesn't have any experience in anything but vanilla (and even that was a very long time ago).  The erotic books her editor Ross leant her have her imagination in overdrive and him starring as the hero in every single fantasy.Over the past decade she's locked herself away from the world with only her cat Duke for company - and of course the Thursday night pizza date with Ross.  Two months ago her beloved companion Duke passed away leaving her depressed, lonely and in a funk that she's been unable to shake.  Ross suggested she make a major change in her life and offered his cabin in West Virginia as an escape.  That it's January, the dead of winter and it's snowing with no signs of letting up is a little disconcerting.  In New York when the doldrums set in she could head out to be around other human beings.  She'll be staying in this cabin for months and being snowed in isn't a thought she relishes.Ross Philips has been Julia's best friend and editor for the past decade and over the past several years discovered that his feelings for her go much deeper.  He's afraid she wouldn't be able to handle his strong sexual appetites so he's kept his attraction to her a secret and dated a bevy of beauties, which Julia refers to as ""The Miss America brigade.""  Since the death of Duke, she's stopped writing and sunk into a depression which entices Ross to tempt her into making some major changes in her life and hopefully a big part of those changes will involve the two of them and tangled sheets.Julia thinks she'll be at the cabin all alone until Ross arrives bringing supplies and a few other odds and ends. While she's certainly happy to see him the reason for his arrival isn't at all clear.  She's not really buying that he came out there concerned for her well being because of the snowstorm but what other possible reason could he have?  It's not until he questions her about her ideals for her erotic book that things take a shocking turn.  Ross volunteers to help her with her erotic research and he's fully prepared to introduce her to all sorts of wickedly exciting ideas.  Julia isn't at all convinced that he'd truly want her - more than likely she's just convenient - but Ross isn't going to give up and being snowed in with him will allow them time to get to know each other much, much better.  What will happen when their time together at the cabin comes to an end though?EROTIC RESEARCH is Mari Carr's first published work and I must say she delivers a delightfully satisfying read.  I found it very easy to empathize with Julia and her self preservation by hiding away from the world.  Ross is a wonderfully caring man who has spent the past decade getting to know Julia and treasures their friendship - even while knowing that he desires much more from her.  Ms. Carr doesn't skimp on any of the research `techniques' and I must say Julia is a very willing subject. This is a delightful read that combines plenty of red hot sex, emotional angst, some soul searching and best of all a lasting love that develops from a genuine friendship.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","02 21, 2009",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

She immediately revises her thoughts that Trouble means abstinence.  However, several accidents occur including some near fatal ones as if someone wants to prevent Lottie from completing her assignment.  Simon thinks the hotel is haunted, but Lottie believes a mortal person wants her stopped.The sequel to the amusing contemporary HERE COMES TROUBLE is a delightful investigative romance in which the lead couple explores the haunting of the hotel and their hearts.  The story line contains plenty of action, but it is the lead couple who keeps it focused and entertaining as she knows what she wants (sex not a lasting love) and he knows she is trouble (he has enough tsuris without her).

6812,13837,B0039LDIOM,"[1, 1]",3,"Previously straight identified college senior Jeremy is conflicted after drunkenly sleeping with his best friend and college roommate Ben. Adding to his discomfort is his growing disinterest in his girlfriend, and the impending changes signaled by his college graduation.Overall I have mixed feelings about this novella. While it had several hot, well written sex scenes and for the most part, able yeoman-like prose advancing the story-line, there were some transitional glitches melding the narrative story-line with the erotic scenes. Admittedly these are two very different forms of storytelling and I felt that they both warranted more development and smoother transitions than the short novella form afforded them.Another shortcoming I perceived was the ""almost adequate"" development of the main characters. We are told a few things about each of the main characters but not really enough to allow us to get fully inside their heads and fully appreciate their feelings. In part, readers read to live vicariously and when the character development is stinted, some of that fulfillment is short-changed. Again, this could have been better if the overall form had not been so rushed.Also on a mixed note, the ability of the author to create charming supporting characters is clearly shown with Al the straight but Texan roommate but the girl friend failed to ring true on almost all levels. There was no detail that allowed me to reconcile what Jeremy had originally seen in her with her nasty racist and sexist hate speech during their break-up scene. It just felt artificial, or worse, poorly written.Finally, the novella starts with a steamy recollection/fantasy but is then jolted back into a straight boy realizing he's not story. I was surprised a bit by my own reaction to having to re-imagine the boyfriend after it was reveal that he was black. While it certainly didn't affect his sexiness, it wasn't made clear in the initial description and my fantasy lover's tend to be white. For a while I found myself contemplating what my level of racism was rather than concentrating on the details of the story. However this morphed into my speculation about how much more I could have appreciated the story if I'd been given some of the build-up before the major sex scene.As with so many stories that give details like this, It's a bit tricky deciding just how much detail to reveal. It's a bit like being given a perfectly brewed cup of coffee with two sugars and milk. No matter how great the coffee and perfect the brew if one takes ones coffee unsweetened and black, it's a bit hard to appreciate the overall beverage.Overall, I've decided that I enjoyed it but will be curious to read something longer by the author to see if the imperfections I found here are cured when she has more room to work. Read it and judge for yourself.","01 22, 2013",A3JGYMAPJN7BSA,"Havan_IronOak ""Havan_Ironoak""",Not entirely satisfying melding of interesting story and erotic writing,1358812800

(I don't want to estimate how long it would take to read the Sunday edition.) Now that I'm older and have family, a career, and a life, there is no way I could devote that much of my life to reading a paper.In addition, the cost of buying the Times is high, even on a Kindle.So the Times has taken an interesting approach to the Kindle. In addition to making the full paper available, it has also made sub-sections of the paper available through Kindle Blogs, at a much cheaper price. This blog is the best selling NYT Blog, but you may be more interested in one of the other NYT Blogs, which are listed on an Amazon Listomania list.  (I'd include the address here, but Amazon blocked it so go to my profile for the list.)The Latest News blog is a blog which is updated several times a day with the latest articles from the Times. Most of the aticles are hard news. However, occassional sports and lifestyle articles also appear, as well a very ocassional analysis article. Other than the analysis article, there was very little opportunity for any leftist bias in the articles.Unlike most current newspapers, the articles in the Times tend to be longer, with more background and context.There are two downsides to this blog. First, the New York Times is a New York paper. Some of the news articles will be New York news. Not many, but a few of them. If you live in Florida as I do, you may wish to skip those articles.Second is the transient nsture of all Kindle blogs. If you see an article you want to read later, TURN OFF YOUR WIRELESS until you've read the article. Otherwise you may loose the article with the next update.I have also occassionally lost sync with Amazon's servers. If your subscription doesn't update, just restart your Kindle.

Yet it develops the theme of overcoming old wounds which is one I particularly love to read.  I picked it up after reading and liking another book of hers, His Majesty Prince of Toads.The fun premise is a magical brew (a love potion)that is causing all the bachelor's to marry. The Earl of Vailmont doesn't believe the rumors, however, and is determined to prove his theory that there is no magic involved. In typical rouge fashion, he sets out to show his friends that he can associate with women without getting caught. Unfortunately, he chooses Sylvia to experiment with and becomes attracted to her. This pits Val against Sylvia in a game of pursuit as old as time.You can read this for the fun, surface story of magical love potions, lusty protagonists, and fears of marriage and really enjoy this book. You can also read this for the underlying story where both Val and Sylvia have suffered  great losses--loss that has always stood in the way of true happiness and finding love. Though they each approach their losses--betrayal, moral dilemmas, death, in different ways it is that approach and that desire to find love that is for me the real conflict in this story and what puts it above many others in this genre.","11 28, 2010",A1PMYWK6CVJJNI,MaggieMae,Rogues Get Caught,1290902400

Though the writing in this self-published offering is sometimes a little repetitive and clunky, it never sinks to sloppy or slapdash levels.  Besides, the scene setting and descriptions of Victorian London more than compensate: both aspects are moody and effective, nicely drawing the reader into Henkel's world of demons and supernatural investigation.My other criticisms are basically quibbles. I would have liked to see more dialogue between Dark and his supporting cast members; it would have enabled us to get to know everyone a little better, as well as break up the large blocks of dense description (usually of streets and buildings) in the prose.  Also, an occasional plot twist or dramatic revelation would have punched things up a little, especially at the end, where all we get is a long fight scene (though not a bad one).  But, again, I liked the moody, creepy vibe Henkel delivers throughout, and more importantly, I cared about Jason Dark and the people around him.From reading Mr. Henkel's book description here on Amazon (as well as his recent blog postings), I learned that I apparently just missed a revised version of ""Demon's Night"", which includes a new cover, a lower price, and a polishing of the prose.  So the most recent version of this book might be better than I'm giving it credit for here.  It's certainly cheaper.Will I come back for more?  Sure.  While perhaps lacking the crispness and total polish of a novel one might pick up at your local book store, the sudden availability of interesting self-published offerings like Guido Henkel's Jason Dark books on the Kindle more than compensates for any slight shortcomings in the final product, at least in this case.And, as we all well know, it's not like ""officially"" published books are perfect, either.","03 10, 2011",A3GRN6J64F2C3X,"Joseph P.

This book takes you through step by step processes to create your own and shows you every day applications for them.Allow me to quote from the first paragraph from the book - ""We live in the information age, which means that our problem is less one of obtaining information and more one of retaining and organising all the quantities of information that we are required to ingest-both during our studies and afterwards.""This is so true of my life. I feel that my brain is so cluttered with so many muddled thoughts that I can't easily access things I need and am left feeling confused and disorganised. Mind Maps is a tool that will enable me to use both sides of my brain rather than one; thus enabling my brain to perform 5-10 times more effectively. Show me a person who doesn't want that in their life! It simplifies complicated information by breaking it down into a diagram that delivers the information in a quick glance `map' rather than long laborious lists which are hard to digest.I can see that it would have great uses for students, writers or anyone giving a presentation. I personally am non academic and live on a homestead farm; for me in everyday life I can see several uses for planning my garden and renovation projects and to solve problems that crop up therein. I can also see it would be beneficial to estimate a timescale to these events. At the moment I seem to have list upon list of countless tasks that now seem insurmountable. I plan to sit down with a large sheet of paper and create my own Mind Map this very evening.The book also includes access to free software.

I really liked Robyn because she wasn't afraid to speak her mind even though she's deaf she was definetly a strong female lead in the beginning but as the book progressed I hated the fact that she began to defer to Keil more and more, yet with others she'd be more of an alpha herself. I thought that part was a bit ridiculous but that's just me.I found that the basic plot of the book was pretty good given that the book is less than 100 pages long. I liked it but as some readers may know I'm not overtly fond really short books or e-books. I like my books to be longer, my other issue with the book was that while I knew it might be a little steamy with the sex stuff I thought it was really awkward and forced as if the writer was uncomfortable writing about the sex scenes and that bugged me.However, the book was pretty funny. There were plenty of parts where I had t chuckle because the author actually seems to have a pretty good sense of humour, but I wish she used it more. In the end though I actually thought this was a pretty good book. I've read better and I've certainly read worse. I wish the book dealt more with the shifting side and less of the sex side but I know I'll have to read the rest of the series like I'm planning to.It's worth the read, it killed some time and it was better than I thought it would be. I think if you're a  fan of the genre and like these sorts of book then you should check this one out. It's worth it and I really recommend it :)","05 5, 2012",A2MEO5TUGBLY1J,Kimberly,Worth Reading!,1336176000

What's implausible is how the central character, Ann, is involved in the first shots of this war, immediately escapes to London only to be directly involved in a second major event, very little of which is written about or explained.I was confused as to whether Ann was sympathetic to Islam or not given her wild swings in thought. I suppose she herself wasn't sure what to think. In fairness I think the author was trying to present two opposing views although they didn't flow very well in the book.The part I found the most unbelievable is that a lot, if not most, of the Muslims in Europe and the US are covert terrorists waiting for that one phone call/ text message / verbal password, to erupt in violence. It seemed as though every Muslim in a European army immediately switched sides and started fighting the Christians. In other words, there's no such thing as a moderate Muslim.The book overreaches itself when a plague breaks out, abruptly changing the tempo of the narrative. Perhaps that part could have been dropped in favour of better character development and more in depth descriptions of events.","09 13, 2013",A1J9DRPXY9ME8Q,Amazon Customer,I'm ambivalent on the one,1379030400

Penny and Jace were such engaging characters, making great equal partners when it was called for, but also falling easily into the more traditional roles of meek woman and strong, protective man at other times, and it was fascinating to see the movement back and forth between the two.

She is subject to frequent spankings, embarrassing physical examinations, daily enemas, and being put on display. She is taught to obey and submit to whatever her new papa might do to her.I read the reviews and the description of this book and was looking forward to reading it. It did not live up to my expectations. There is a lot of spanking that happens and that is alright. I have never really cared for it and don't quiet understand the obsession that some people have with it but to each their own. I liked the part about enemas being administered but the book didn't really talk about it. It pretty much just told you that they had them and that is it.To tell the truth I found the book to be a bit boring. I did not find the parts that were supposed to be erotic exciting at all. I like more action in my erotic books, something to actually happen to them and for them to enjoy it. Throughout the whole book Clara only has one orgasm and that was done by a whole lot of touching. She has enemas, plugs put in her, spanked, put on display, rarely touch in a sensual way and often she didn't find much enjoyment in these things. I am fine with almost anything being done to a person as long as they are actually getting real pleasure out of it.One of the other reviews was right. This book read a lot like those old Victorian erotica. If you have read Slaves of the Hypnotist by Bill Adler or First Training by James Jennings then this book reads a lot like those.

She also knows what she wants, and what she wants is to be a part of the vampire sex club, Midnight Playground, to be the recipient of the Seeking Kiss (where vampires would take blood) and, if she were lucky, the Turning Kiss (to become a vampire, one of them). She was given the chance when a friend sponsored her entry. Almost immediately, two gorgeous vampires, Hex and his master Aleron, sought her out. Soon she finds herself falling for one of them.From the first page, I was captivated. Eden Bradley's prose and descriptions of the vampires and the club were rich in detail, making me feel I was really there. Also, there is something compelling and attractive about a woman who knows what she wants and who does all things possible to get it, even to the point of risking all.I don't think though that Nissa's fascination with vampires was ever explained. Why this obsession to enter the vampire sex club? Maybe as a place to belong, since she'd been virtually alone from a young age? However, the question didn't really bother me as I read along, ready to be swept into the fantasy, until this bit of conversation came along:She realized she was naked. And that Hex was lying beside her. When she turned her head his dark gaze was on her face.""I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you."" He reached out, drew one finger along her jaw. ""But I can't stop looking at you. You've been so beautiful these past hours as you slept.""She didn't know what to say in response.Er, was she not beautiful when she was awake? However, we were told that she is, as both Hex and Aleron couldn't stop telling her how beautiful she was.Anyway...I like the twist in this story though.

Freak City is a much darker story than the first, and the characters have less charm.  I thought that Argus-as-a-child (from the 1st book) had great potential, but it would seem that he did not live up to it - though there are hints at the very end that things may change.The storyline was good, and the puzzle that Argus set out to solve was intriguing, but I also get the feeling that the author may have lost his grip on the story somewhat.  I won't provide spoilers, but there was one comment made at the beginning of the story that was never mentioned again - and to me, it seemed that that was the crux of the whole story.  I kept waiting for Argus to put two and two together and remember that comment, but it never happened.  Instead the characters danced around that issue without it ever coming to the fore (where I think it belonged).  This is supposed to be Book 2 of a trilogy, so perhaps the author intended it to 'lead up to' the finale in the 3rd book.All in all, a good little book (very short, probably novella length) with an interesting cast of characters.  It's definitely Number Two in a series, so readers should start with Snapdragon Alley in order to pick up the background.Note on Kindle formatting:  Perfect, or nearly so.

What was most interesting, though, was the concept of a race from the stars who are intelligent, gentle, and devoted to one another. Very nice. I know some were frustrated by the fact that Kent took to Povre so easily. Hey, get a grip, people! It is a story - a very sweet story of the most unusual kind of 'cross-racial' relationship. Extremely cross-racial, as in cross-species. But how is that any more questionable than the whole ""woman meets vampire/werewolf/demon/angel"" thing that is so popular these days? I love those, too!

She's been living and working in Great Falls but her father's ranch is where her heart truly lies.  There's just the little issue of her love for Wolfe, Cash and Travis and how wrong loving them seems.Brothers Wolfe, Cash and Travis have been in love with Stacy for years.  They've done their best to protect her from her father's bullying and hateful attitude.  They've never expressed their feelings to Stacy and now with her father gone they feel it's time for her to come back to the ranch - where she belongs - as their woman.Stacy's guilt over the perceived wrong on being in love with three men is emotionally agonizing.  She's convinced her only option is to sell the beloved ranch and return to Great Falls as soon as possible.  Only first she has to consult the attorney about the property and for some reason the man is never available.  That means she spends a lot of time around the ranch and avoiding Wolfe, Cash and Travis is impossible especially when each of them keeps such a close eye on her.  When each man individually seduces her she becomes even more confused and scared.  Despite the men's insistence that she is home, she's determined to leave and doesn't believe there's any way she can confide in them about her feelings for them all.  As it is she's afraid they're going to find out that's she's cheated on each of them with their own brother.  Only there are things that Stacy doesn't know which will shock and change everything she's ever believed.  Will she stay after learning the truth about the ranch and what her father did?HER DAKOTA MEN takes readers on an emotional journey along with the characters as each comes to grips with their feelings and what they mean for their future.  Stacy's generous nature and love for the ranch and everyone who resides there really touches your heart even as you wonder how she could be such a sweet person when her father was so mentally abusive.  Wolfe, Cash and Travis are wonderful men who want nothing more than Stacy's happiness - and for her to stay at the ranch.  They're all dominant men by nature and their interactions with Stacy are beyond scorching.

The author examines his thoughts and feelings (both mental and physical) pertaining to his amputated arm in a good amount of detail. His musings about it are pervasive, but I didn't find them annoying; they're reflective and a little sad, but he's not overly despairing or dramatic about it.- I also liked that Nicky is just the slightest bit on the standoffish side when it comes to Ian, yet he's also the aggressor in their relationship.- I've read quite a few Regency romances over the years, both m/f and m/m, but the characters in this story participate in some holiday festivities and games that I'd never read about before and that give the story a fun, unique feel.- The ending of the novella contains an unusual plot twist that I liked a lot. (I don't want to say more because I'm afraid I'll give something away.)CONS:- Mitchell uses occasional foreign phrases throughout the story, and I must admit to my ignorance of the meaning of some of them, which made certain sentences basically incomprehensible to me. For example: ""As injurious as this fortnight was to Ian's mens sana, it was a boon to his corpore sano.""- There are a couple (but only a couple) conversations that contained fewer speech tags (""he said"") than I wanted; that is, I was confused for a short time as to who was speaking, what the characters' relationship was, who the people being referred to were, etc. The first of these conversations is at the very beginning of the story.Overall comments: My one main complaint about this story is that it's short; that's not to say that it's TOO short, though. I just didn't want it to end. I loved the treatment of Ian's disability, especially how gentle and reassuring Nicky is without emasculating Ian at all.

He's let fame sideline him for a while but now he's back on track and determined that nothing will prevent him from achieving his goals - and since he's single there isn't even a woman to distract him.Sydney Hart is the little sister of his good friend Dusty and she's part owner of a Las Vegas bar called Cowboy Up.  Of course Levi doesn't know that before stepping foot in the bar and witnessing her rendition of Kelley Pickler's `One of the Guys.'  He's always thought she was beautiful but watching other men drool over her inflames all his possessive instincts.  He made a promise to Dusty years ago that he'd never touch Sydney - but some promises are meant to be broken.Sydney has lousy taste in men and never has any trouble attracting jerks.  Her last boyfriend is still obsessively watching her so she's not in any big hurry to hook up with another man who'll make her life a living hell.  Of course she knows enough about Levi to trust him to not be psychotic and there's definitely a sexual attraction that's impossible to resist.At first Sydney and Levi keep their relationship strictly on a friendship level but as time progresses and they spend more and more time together the attraction proves to be too much and one kiss quickly leads to other far more intimate moments.Levi has quite a reputation with the ladies and he isn't interested in soiling his relationship with Sydney by allowing the press to get wind of it.  Levi and Sydney's romance is as wild as their Texas hearts unleashed on a Las Vegas strip but can they withstand an angry brother and an obsessive ex?BUCKLING DOWN is a red hot scorching romance which is as hot as Texas - and as wild as Las Vegas.  Moira Keith installs plenty of humor, passion, emotion and non-stop action in this captivating tale.  Rodeo cowboys give women lots of moments of intense joy just watching the way they move so you can just imagine how exciting Levi is to any woman who comes in contact with him.  Sydney's got a spirit that matches Levi perfectly and keeps him coming back for more.  BUCKLING DOWN is a perfect addition to the WILD RIDE anthology.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","05 30, 2009",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

This is a useful guide for everyone from students to professionals. It broke things down, was easy to understand, and offered interesting insights not just about mind mapping, but other learning disciplines as well.At the start of the book, mind-mapping is described as being much like our minds making connections. It's the linking of these ideas and the visual aspect of it that led to the process. The process of mind mapping is a bit more involved than regular note-taking, but can be used for a number of projects and as a writer, I'm looking forward to applying what I've learned. Within a few pages, I was already planning to pitch mind mapping as a project management process for my office and now we are working on one using the techniques learned here.Interestingly, the book touched briefly on other techniques to enhance learning such as speed reading. You'd think speed reading is a digression from mind mapping, however, for me, it actually enhanced the concept. The speed reading technique shown works in line with the theory behind mind maps and how our mind process sight quicker than other forms of data.I also realized th at the reasons I gave up mind mapping before was because I didn't practice. Like everything, practice does make perfect and now that I'm feeling more encouraged to try it again, I've been mind-mapping a list of everything I'd like to organize. It's a different thought process I'll admit, but it is worth it to try.","07 25, 2013",A3HPRFI2RUNPHJ,LisaS.,Visually Stimulating note-taking,1374710400
6911,24180,B003Z0CUJG,"[1, 1]",1,"This is one of the most ridiculous books that I have ever read.  It doesn't seem as if the author understood very much about the way the world works at all.  One of the main characters became a lawyer right after graduating college (it doesn't seem as if the author knows about the existence of law school) and another main character is given full scholarships and acceptance letters from two different colleges from a high school teacher without even applying to either college.  The mechanics of adoption are also presented really fuzzily.  There are open adoptions available -- it doesn't have to be the way the author presented it.  You also just can't terminate a father's parental rights without giving a child up for adoption -- but I guess a lawyer who didn't go to law school can't be expected to challenge that.Aside from the facepalm-worthy factual errors, this book is just tedious to read.  Shawna is so thoughtless and dumb that she brings the vast majority of her problems upon herself.  The other characters are just like cardboard cutouts surrounding her.  Conrad and his mother are too evil to be believed and the various friends that Shawna makes along the way are just too good to be true while also inexplicably falling by the wayside when she actually needs help.Nobody really talks or acts like a real person.  It was unclear why Conrad wanted a family so much and why he had to have a sixteen-year-old as his girlfriend.  It was also unclear why Shawna would go along with this when she love him so little that she fell for the first guy who asked her out on a lunch date.Everything about this book is purely ridiculous.  Even if the editing issues were fixed, it isn't like reading a book set in the real world.  I would only recommend this for hardcore readers of woe-is-me fiction who will accept a massively unrealistic tacked-on happy ending.  Everyone else should avoid.","10 6, 2013",A3A7FF87LEVCQ1,morehumanthanhuman,Ridiculous,1381017600

There she opens up The Chocolaterie Store and raising their two children Mica and Christopher as a single mother.Friends set up Liz on a blind date with senatorial aide Carter Hudson.  She dislikes his ease of talking about her personal mess and his condemnation of her letting Keith get away with his crap.  However, Carter does not allow the fact that she has two kids deter him from seeing Liz.  She soon sees how kind he is to her children and how much he tries to help her at her shop.  Though she vowed never again Liz falls in love with Carter, who reciprocates her feelings, but she wonders if she can trust love after the Keith fiasco.THE OTHER WOMAN is an interesting contemporary romance starring a likable woman who though upset with her former spouse remains on good terms with him especially for the sake of their children as the character driven story line is kept focused on Liz.  Carter is an intriguing protagonist who sounds obnoxious on their first blind date, but proves first opinions can be false as he turns out to be a nice nurturing person.

I get the impression from many of the current programmes that what they really want is to push the sex angle as far as they can without getting banned or reprimanded, so this seemed like something possible at some time in the future.

Well, as I said I thought this would be fun. A bit of sexy, spicy, erotica wrapped up in an interesting story. Sadly I was wrong, and what this consists of in my opinion is simply page after page after page of sex, self pleasure, with a partner or with multiple partners, with a flimsy, feeble story as an excuse for carrying it. The plot is thin, really poorly put together, (for instance landlords of commercial properties don't call round for a cheque days after a rent rise...it's all BACS transactions..) with the sex part being so repetitive its actually a turn off. I ended up skim reading pages just to see what happened, and get to the end.

The new temping outfit she is wearing is nothing like her normal work clothes and she really can't stand the sting of the thong, but if this is what it takes...Ridge Casey is co-owner of an architectural firm and he is headed in today hoping to learn that they have won a new project bid.  When he gets into the office, two things give his stomach a punch.  The first is Morgan and her new outfit and just how many of the other men at the firm have seen her in it, and the second is that they were somehow outbid again.Ridge has no choice but to deal with Morgan and her sexy outfit since his pants are beginning to not feel so comfortable.  Today is going to be both the best and the worst for Morgan.  She gets everything she has always wanted and watches as it begins to disappear when she is suspected of being a saboteur.Between a Ridge and a Hard Place is fast-paced and extremely sexy.  Ridge has ignored Morgan for a year now and she is tired of watching his constant parade of women.  Ridge has wanted Morgan for the entire year she has worked for him, but she just hasn't given any signs of how she feels.  I loved it when Ridge saw Morgan and her new outfit for the first time and his immediate reaction to it.  From the way they exploded with each other, I'm surprised that they lasted a year.  While I will admit that I figured out the who did it part before it was announced, it was skillfully done.  Between a Ridge and a Hard Place grabbed me from the first paragraph and did not let go until I turned the last page.  I suggest a large bottle of cold water and locking yourself in a room because you won't want to be interrupted.

Her books specialize in Regency period England, M/M erotic romances.  And they are all filled with scorching hot erotic scenes between well drawn, flawed yet generally sympathetic characters who one hopes will find a way to a permanent loving relationship.  The fact that this (as do all her books) takes place in an era when anal sex could get guys hanged (literally) for sodomy added an extra challenge to a plot involving two men seeking more than just companionship.Her books all involve some strong tension / conflict between the protagonists, and this one is no exception.  Arsen is rich, powerful, sexually adept, socially prominent yet a ""bad boy"" and ""known"" womanizer, but he is not satisfied with any of his previous mistresses and not in search of a virginal young woman / debutante to marry.  Harry is a big, gorgeous, raw-boned hunk, with only minimal sexual experience, who has the ""misfortune"" to have fallen head over heels in love with straight, womanizer Arsen, usually a recipe for disaster if ever there was one.  So the two have some dancing around each other to do before either reveals his true feelings, then those initial revelations are incomplete, leading to some misconceptions and wrong ""conclusions.""  Not necessarily the most creative plotline, but lots of tension and uncertainty, great characters who are flawed but sympathetic, and enjoyable escapist literature.

Usually in romance novels, its a real turn off to find out either the hero or the heroine had strayed to 'greener pastures'. Most of the time rather than actually actually committing the act of infidelity, there is a misunderstanding between the hero and the heroine which is always later resolved in the novel. However it is not the case in the story of Katie and Cutter.In the first book of this series which I didn't read but was able to make out what happened by reading this book, Katie sleeps with Justin Cruz, now husband of Cutter's sister Dani Standifer. Although Katie was in a relationship with Cutter at that time, no matter how wrong infidelity is, Katie was feeling vulnerable and alone cos Cutter wouldn't really open up to her and give her what she needed.Katie has regretted sleeping with Justin from the moment Cutter finds out what happened between the two. Resolving never to let Katie into his life again, which is a bargain he has held till now, seeing Katie gatecrash Dani's wedding party is the last straw for Cutter. Thinking Katie had come to mourn over Justin, Cutter treats Katie like trash and takes what he has always wanted from her. Katie gives herself to Cutter thinking that she might get a second chance to work things out with him if she lets him have his way with her.These two embark on a purely sexual relationship, the consequence of which renders Katie pregnant. I felt that this story was too rushed and thus the resolving of the conflict between Katie and Cutter didn't quite give the satisfaction that I was craving as the reader. This story would have been much better and a more memorable one if the author had taken time to actually develop Katie and Cutter's characters a bit more and resolve the trust issues Cutter had with Katie in a more believable manner rather than just all of a sudden confessing that he loves Katie and wants her to be his wife.Anyhow okay for a quick read that doesn't require much thinking on the reader's part.","01 28, 2010",A576L6YAOW6IP,"maldivianbookreviewer ""Book Reviews - From th...",Actually 2 and 1/2 star,1264636800

If your a fan of forced seduction then this book will work for you. I did not enjoy it. To close to rape for my liking.Unlike the first book Ral&#8217;s Woman where Ral shows a genuine affection and protective concern for his human, Argernon dose not show these qualities for Casey until much much later in the book. Argernon is entirely shellfish and demands that Casey stay; because he can&#8217;t live without her. He gives her no choice. The same seduction techniques that Argernon uses are just like her ex who was trying to forcer her, and she should have told Argernon and he should have backed off and gotten to know her without the bondage.

Around 30% into the book we get some action outside the bedroom which was a change, but other then that it&#8217;s all about Argernon not letting Casey go.If you like to read a series in order then I recommend this book, but in general if your into overbearing alien men who don&#8217;t have a clue about women&#8217;s rights and like to use sex as a weapon to get what they want then you&#8217;ll like this, otherwise I would not recommend this one.","03 28, 2014",A3ANLUEKJBC1IZ,"Angela @ Angel's Guilty Pleasures ""Angel's Gu...",Review Kidnapping Casey,1395964800

She is excited about the opportunity before her but apprehensive at the same time.She is in love with Mark but because of her bad history with guys she thinks Mark is getting ready to break up with her.  He blew her off on her birthday and scheduled her to work, why else would he do this unless he was tired of her.Sam is glad to join in on their fun but one look at Mark with Jodi and he knows he's a third wheel.  He cares about his friend and is determined to make his friend admit what is in his heart, even if he hates him when he is done.  Jodi is beautiful and responsive to his every touch and he just wants Mark to realize the treasure he has.Mark isn't into long term relationships until Jodi.  She is smart and beautiful and he doesn't want to share her, even if it's to fulfill her fantasies.  He's angry at Sam because he has to sit and watch their play without participating.  He is also extremely turned on watching Sam dominate her but he has an overwhelming urge to mark her as his.This story was hot, sexy and a lot of fun.  Mark was super sweet to arrange for Jodi's fantasies to be played out, even if he wasn't crazy about another man touching her.  The dominate scene with Sam was powerful but I think the scene afterward with just the two of them was even more powerful.The characters were kept to a minimum which worked for this story.  There was also enough back story for the reader to understand what was going on, without over powering them with too much information.  It was also fun learning a little about the security business.Overall I really enjoyed this book and can't wait to pick up the 2nd and 3rd book in this series.  I want to learn more about Sam.

Who doesn't want that?The idea of mind mapping is that it helps you organise ideas. So instead of taking notes line by line, the idea is to place the central theme or keyword in the middle of the page and add more keywords surrounding it, with lines drawn between them to represent their relationships.According to this book (and now I know, it definitely makes sense!), mind mapping makes you more effective because this method is more compatible with the brain. This is because it matches how the brain functions biologically. Mind mapping also engages both halves of your brain at once, making you much more efficient and effective.A key poi nt, and one very important to me personally is that mind mapping is supposed to enhance creativity. As a writer, there are few skills which are more important! I imagine many writers would find mind mapping a very useful way of planning out their work, linking together various ideas, characters and plot points.As the book says, it'll be difficult to break my habit of making linear notes and the mind mapping will take practice. I've only really covered how I personally will find mind mapping useful, but the book covers a wide variety of ways in which it helps people, for example; note taking, brainstorming, collaborative writing, problem resolution and more.So if you're looking for a way to make your planning and note-taking go more smoothly and effectively, then this book is ideal.","03 4, 2011",A2L3ZY42HQY5FL,Lucy Felthouse,An excellent resource,1299196800

There's a healthy cast of characters and beginning threads of secondary plotlines - this is the first in a series - but you don't get anything of any real depth. There is no chance to grow invested in the lead couple, to care if things work out for them. And once the regular sex starts (instead of just the anticipation of same), everything else just stops anyway.But even the sex lacks depth. The BDSM lifestyle isn't really explored in any way. You get the usual explanation of what draws the heroine, the relief of a woman with overwhelming responsibilities letting someone else have control. But you never get any insight into his impulses. In fact, except for the fact that he's doing the spanking, the hero doesn't come across as a dominant at all. It bugged me.However, it wasn't bad. And it was free.

Carson has always been known to be wild and a playboy, never having relationships except one night stands.  During his best friend's bachelor party, he was starting to feel nostalgic and began to think about his own life and how perhaps it was time to tame his wild ways and settle down.  While talking to his friend, a beautiful brunette comes over and asks him and his friends to take her dancing.  He jumps at the opportunity to dance with Holly. During their dance, the attraction is incredible between them and they indulge in one fantastic one night stand in the club's storage closet.  Holly leaves right after their hot encounter and leaves Carson dumbfounded.  A month later, they run into each other at a wedding and they both couldn't forget their best sex ever experience in the closet.

I was expecting a deep romance with a perceptive, empathic hero and a heroine who had been royally screwed by her fiance and sister.  This book was just rushed and weird.  It was like the author was in a hurry and left out details and wanted to throw way too much into this short book.First, there were alot of things just thrown in and blown over.  I cannot recall if I read what the heroine does for a living.  Also, there was alot of drama surrounding the sister running off with the fiance on the wedding day but there were no details given about the sisters' relationship before the incident.  There is the mention of a few other visitors and employees at the dude ranch but they are all glossed over. There is another man interested in thd heroine briefly.  He is given about 2 pages.  There is very little character development and I did not care about any of these people.  Even the sex scenes were skimpy and rushed.When the heroine goes to the ranch, there is a little drama with another woman who is chasing the hero but even this was confusing.  It was really not necessary to the story and the drama was not fully developed.  Just thrown in here and there almost like an after thought.Also, the heroine spends the first part of the book disliking the hero just because he was handsome and she was attracted to him, I think.  Not really sure why.  He spends all his time telling her he knows she does not like him.  That is the extent of his perceptive empath abilities.The secret is frankly, stupid.  I won't give it away but I guessed it pretty early.  I was hoping I was wrong because it really did not fit in with the story.  When it finally came out, even the reveal was less than satisfactory.  I cannot say more without spoiling this.The interracial aspect of this novel was non-existent.  There was a BRIEF mention of race and that was all.  These people could have been blue for all race mattered.The ending was a complete rushed cop out.  It really felt like the author realized ""oh yeah, I need to write a last chapter"" so she did so without any real buildup.  If you cared about the characters (which I did not), you would feel cheated by how fast their ""conflict"" was resolved and how.Two stars because this author has done better and she did make the effort to write this book.

The book is of a decent length, and laid out (no pun intended) nicely for the Kindle, as if someone actually spent time to cleanly convert the text to the digital medium.

He helps the family in this time of grief, makes small talk, arranges the myriad of food that people bring, and he's oddly obsessed with making  sure everybody gets a piece of pie.  Why pie?  Oh, you'll find out.Much of the pleasure of this book is in the description of the relationships in a southern family.  They grieve for the loss of a husband and father, but not so much as to forget their concerns with who inherits  an old tractor,  a plow horse, and other items.  Family members argue, they vie for positions, discuss things that seem odd to be voiced in front of the widow (and BY the widow) - yet at the same time they check to see that proper wake protocols are being followed.This all seems so real. Yet it is juxtaposed with the surreal in the story of Roby.  Roby has sold his soul to the devil and part of the pact is to make sure the family mourners eat a piece of this special pie.The story was very strange, but in a good way.  I couldn't figure out where it was going until I got to the ""ah ha!"" moment.  And then I still couldn't figure it all out!Interesting premise, but I was left wanting more details about the pacts with the devil.  But maybe that was what Scott Nicholson intended.

The only thing that you can be sure of is that whatever surprises she has in store, they will be entertaining. Lover Enslaved was definitely no exception.It should be no surprise that the characters are what made this book so much fun. They were witty, fun, just the right amount of snarky and the supporting characters were just as much fun as Dash and Mara. Of course there were some serious moments too. Both of these characters had been through a lot and they both had their own share of secrets. During the course of this story they both discovered as much about themselves as they did about each other.The bad guys were despicable, the humor was as smart as it was funny, the characters had depth and there was just enough action to keep everyone happy. I also have to mention that I can't remember the last time I read a book by Jodi Redford that had quite this much *ahem* tension. By the end of the book I actually felt sorry for Dash. There's only so much torture a sex crazed Fae should have to endure.As usual, pay attention to the warning... it's for real and not an exaggeration.

When reading this, you just need to accept what's going on and kind of find out later the 'why' of it all.The whole fairy-goddess part seemed cheap and not at all as holy or gaia-like as the characters' respect for the fairy.

But can the four of them find a happy, albeit erotic, future together, or is it really just a fairy tale?Comments:- Contemporary paranormal (shape shifting) erotic romance.- 3329 kindle locations (finishes around 3200 locations)- m/f - varied, explicit, caring. Some bdsm-lite behavior including hot wax, erotic spanking, mild humiliation, Dominant Alpha males, anal play. No m/m (brothers). Aiming for a committed foursome.- Quite a few editing and proofreading issues on my e-version. Enough to irritate and detract from this reader's enjoyment.Opinion:A very relationship-driven erotic romance following our Goldilocks as she takes on her three were-bears. Not a menage - Oriana never takes on more than one bed partner at a time - but highly erotic and varied as the Men show their different tastes. I liked Oriana - she was sweet and caring and very willing to go with the flow. She needed somewhere to just *be* and someone to simply love her. Getting three sexy men just makes it all the more fun. It's enjoyable, nicely written, and an easy way to pass the time.3.5 stars because of the editing issues, rounded up to 4 because Fanning made Goldilocks work, and made me laugh.Aside:Reminded me a lot ofMikayla's Menby Abby Blake - a sweet, easy woman who just wants to find a comfortable place to be loved.

Oh Mommy, he could get the firstborn kid. *smirk* I am suitably crazy over Lynn Lorenz's stories so I knew in advance that I would love this one. The fact that it describes my idea of the perfect vacation didn't hurt, either.Troy is doing the typical &#34;I can make him love me if we just spend enough time together&#34; single guy dance. In my book, if you have to &#34;make&#34; someone love you then it isn't real. He's been lusting after this idiot, Douglas, for a year. Troy has gone to great lengths to try to make himself attractive to this jerk, even though Troy's best friend describes Troy as smart, witty, and a gorgeous guy with a heart of gold. But, now Troy has his chance. He's spending a week on a cruise with Douglas and other friends and Troy just knows that when the seven days are up, Douglas will be his. When Troy's apartment goes up in flames due to his neighbor smoking while sleeping, Troy is forced out the bathroom window to balance precariously three stories up on a tiny ledge. Yikes!Lucky for Troy, Jason is the gorgeous firefighter who saves him and brings him down on the ladder. Troy realizes at the hospital that he has no one to call to come pick him up. He has no cell phone, no wallet, no money, no home. Troy is shocked when Jason appears at the hospital to check on him and even more surprised when Jason offers to let Troy stay with him until he can get things sorted out. Jason is a little surprised that he made the offer, too, but something about Troy rouses protective and possessive feelings that Jason has never had. It doesn't take these two gorgeous men long before they've fallen into bed and Jason is introducing Troy to a little bondage play. These guys are very intense and the sex is incredible. Jason is determined to give Troy a vacation he won't ever forget, and in the process hopes that Troy won't want to leave when his friends come back.The vacation starts with Jason getting Troy into much better-looking clothes than Dockers and button-downs. Troy is only five years older so why dress like an old man? Next it's up to the lake for a day of Jet Skis and parasailing, stuff Troy's never done before, and they have a blast. Jason takes Troy deep-sea fishing and it's some of the most fun Troy has ever had. Jason doesn't want to bring up looking for a new apartment and Troy doesn't either, but both believe the other wants them to, and so begin the miscommunications. Neither one of them wants to speak up about their feelings for fear if being hurt. Silly men. HA!If you enjoy a lighthearted romance with not a lot of drama but an incredible amount of sex, then this might be the story for you. It's fun, sweet, and sexy with a good ending.

The ""Smart"" zombies kept their thoughts and personality from before they were changed, grew smarter, could talk and became stronger the more they fed, and the ""shamblers"" were just your traditional stupid, non talking ""brainnnnnns"" type. Even though i am a die hard ""brainnnnns"" fan, I liked the new smart zombies. I liked how it showed the story from the zombies point of view. It was more of ""evolution"" than a ""invasion"" of zombies. Its about time zombies became as smart as vampires and take their place as something that could form its own society to feed off the weaker humans. Its soooo nice to see them as something other than a monster to just fear and bash their heads in. I can see great possibilities for the story to grow out to a new world order type thing where the zombies become the dominate species and humans battle for a spot to live and not be food.The typos and mis-labeled/named characters were distracting and confusing. There is a part where Nancy is slapping Jimbo and it says Fred. I had to read that section several times to understand it.

2015,7516,B002RKSZJO,"[0, 0]",3,"""The sea is only the embodiment of a supernatural and wonderful existence.""Professor Pierre Arronax and his assistant, Conseil, join the crew of the Abraham Lincoln to chase down this strange ocean mammal that has been destroying ships. The duo, along with harpooner Ned Land, end up overboard and rescued by what is revealed to be a submarine, not a mammal. This submarine is captained by Nemo, a mysterious man who has eschewed the land in preference to roaming the open seas. Nemo takes the trio twenty thousand leagues across the seas - from the Pacific to the Indian to the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. Along the way, Arronax uncovers bits and pieces about his captain and catalogs the various fish he sees.Jules Verne is basically the Father of Science Fiction. His novels - such as ""Twenty Thousand Leagues"" - were groundbreaking for their time. I'd go so far to say that if it weren't for him, we wouldn't have the science fiction genre at all.That said, this book was supremely dry and dull most of the time. Yes, it is ""hard science fiction"" with lots of attention to detail to the mechanics of underwater ""sailing"" (some of which is incredibly on the mark; others, such as the lamp lighting the way of the Nautilus, laughable and out-dated), but there comes a point when enough is enough. This is particularly prevalent when Arronax/Verne spends multiple pages describing the flora and fauna of the sea in intricate detail (""cataloging fish"" into their species and genus) or having long conversations with other characters about irrelevant history (such as the electric cable stretching from the Americas to Ireland).Again, I greatly appreciate the attention to detail and the thought Verne put into the operation of the Nautilus. That isn't my problem. And I don't mind some detail about the sights Arronax sees while traveling. But the latter in particular ""sinks"" the story. And when the story is as diluted and sparse as it is here, that is nearly a death warrant.The majority of this novel reads as a travelogue, Google Maps directions, an account of someone's rather dull vacation. While there are a few scenes that are particularly interesting (the journey to the Antarctic and nearly being trapped underwater, a way too short squid attack, and some walking underwater scenes), by far most of the book is cataloging fish or boring ""and on Mar 21st, we sailed from X in Y direction to Z"". Yawn. What makes this is even more ridiculous is that Arronax, Ned Land, and Conseil are supposedly held prisoner aboard the Nautilus, so they do not leave and divulge its secrets elsewhere, but no one seems to care about being held against their will until suddenly they are. I'd say ""Stockholm Syndrome"", only they give a half-hearted struggle when Captain Nemo tells them they are stuck on the ship. Based on how it is written and how little concern these characters have to their captivity, I don't know why Verne didn't just have Captain Nemo invite Arronax to journey with him and maybe decide that he didn't WANT them to leave.The only (and by far the best) character in this book is Captain Nemo. Sure, there is Arronax, Conseil, and Ned Land, but calling them ""characters"" is a stretch, unless you are using the most generous of definitions of ""character"". Arronax is probably the best of the trio. He has some moments of humor (as a side note, there is quite a bit of humor, and it is well applied and a good break from the blandness of most of the text) and has a complicated relationship with Nemo. Ned Land would be next. His sole character trait is wanting to kill anything that moves - whales, kangaroo, tigers, you name it. Pretty much any time he appears in the story, it's to talk about wanting to kill something or escape (and honestly, he doesn't even CONSIDER escape until the last 75% of the novel). The absolute worst character, in my opinion, is Conseil. The guy makes Saltine Crackers look like they aren't bland. If you want a cold, blindly loyal servant, this is your man.But I hesitate to blame this lack of characterization on Verne's skill as an author or the standard ""But it's hard scifi, not a character study!"", particularly when you have the complex character of Captain Nemo. What the other characters aren't, Captain Nemo is. Apparently, something bad happened to his wife and his children - something bad enough to make him abandon the land all together and sail in his boat, enacting revenge on passing ships. But he isn't a cold blooded killer - he stays Ned Land's hand, when Ned wants to harpoon a bunch of whales for the hell of it. (Of course, not more than a couple of paragraphs later, Nemo then slaughters a bunch of ""sperm whales"", so calling the guy a hypocrite is definitely in order.)So the story is meh, the characters are meh, and the descriptions are overboard. Part of that is just me not really being that hot on the book (my dad, a retired Navy submariner, and my sister both ADORE this book and think I am mad for not). That's only a small part of ""Twenty Thousand Leagues"". The more important part - and the reason I think that any fan of scifi should read this book - is its influence on the genre. This is the great-great-great-great grandfather of novels like ""Ender's Game"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". So in that regard, this book is priceless - it gives me a better respect for the genre I love.Brought to you by:*C.S.

I understand ""The Chosen Soul"" was HKW's first book written some 10 years ago, and that it was revised by the author after reading some of the reviews.  Well, I think it might have needed a second revision.First off, let me say the author writes very well in general.  She also is highly imaginative and her action/battle scenes are exciting. As I'm still fairly new to the Fantasy Genre, it did take me a few chapters to immerse myself in the world setting.  As in ""Hell Bent"" I felt the situations were reasonably complex and the characters numerous.  It took me a while to sort everything and everyone out.  In fact, by the 40% mark (no page numbers on Kindle) I found myself growing confused about the three male love interests, mixing them up to such an extent that I had to go back to re-establish their identities.  They were all wonderfully handsome, had numerous magical powers, hypnotic eyes and all of them fell heavily for Raven/Winter.  That became a problem for me as the story progressed.  I got a little tired of all the handsome men wanting her so badly.The next problem for me was our heroine, Raven/Winter, herself.  She was kinda wimpy right up to the very end of the book.  I'm sure that finding out your father is a devil would be a shock, as would realizing you have demonic powers of your own.  But when your life, or those of your loved ones are threatened repeatedly (and I do mean, repeatedly, as in everyone is out to kidnap or rape you over and over again), then own those powers and use them to save yourself, woman!  Can't just stand on those exceptional good looks.Full points for the many great plot twists.  However, at one crucial point about 60-70% along, I must have been distracted and missed an important point.....that Cruor was Gray Beard!  Boy, I felt dumb over that one when I had to go back a few chapters to sort it out.  It threw me off that the character was called by both names later on in the narrative.On the whole, the plot was a little disjointed, but the individual plot ideas & inventions were interesting and imaginative.  I liked some of the characters a lot, like Loki and Abonides.  I found the names a little bit difficult at first but got used to it by the end.Perhaps, ultimately a bit dark in tone, and I do agree with other reviewers that the novel ended abruptly, like ""time to wrap this up now and finish up in a sequel some day"".  Raven/Winter didn't win points by resigning herself to life with the Elven Prince, but I guess she was just being practical since Drake was gone.  She was probably tired after fighting off all her abductors and needed a good rest.I will be reading the author's other books as I bought them all, they were such a good price.

When I picked this novella up, I figured that there was no way that any story titled She's Got Balls could possibly take itself seriously. And I was right. She's Got Balls by Mia Watts is a quick and humorous read that revolves around the running gag of a man in a dress. Or, rather, a man trying to deal with torturous panties and the crimp that they put in his out-of-control libido. This story is cute, funny, sexy, and just plain fun.She's Got Balls features two irresistible heroes that you can't help but love. Both are very manly men, but one of them is doomed to spend a lot of time in a dress. Chris is clever, irreverent, mouthy, pushy and constantly has sex on his mind. He might not want to play the girl, but he throws himself into the role completely and is a very quick study. It's very entertaining to watch him try to be ""one of the girls"" because he is such a man. Vin, who gets to be ""the man"" of their couple because of his size and physique, is actually the kinder and gentler of the two. He tends to hold his emotions close to his chest, and although he puts up a tough-guy front, he has a softer side that is in direct contrast.The interaction between the main characters strikes sparks along with being humorous. These two are definitely an ""odd couple."" Chris's goads Vin incessantly just for the pleasure of watching the man react, calling him Gigantor and suggesting that his momma fed him growth hormones, and all the while he just wants to get into his pants. Vin, despite first impressions, is the more even-keeled of the two. When he decides to make his move, however, he is definitely the one in control of the situation. And oh, what control he has. This man definitely knows how to put a pair of gag-gift fuzzy handcuffs to work for him.I was a little disappointed that the investigation in this story did not receive more attention, because I think She's Got Balls would have benefited from a little more ""meat"" in the story and would have made a more effective novel than novella. The investigation seems more of a vehicle to bring the two main characters together and an excuse to get Chris into drag rather than being a true plot device. Regardless, this is a cute and fun story. It tickled me and made me grin, and I thought it was definitely worth the reading time.","12 4, 2009",A3C2JT2GQGB3E,B. D.

One of the characters mentioned the control panels being Star Trek like, and that's not where the similarity ends, and that's not a good thing. The vehicle is grossly and overwhelmingly powerful. It's invulnerable and has no (revealed) weaknesses. It faces two main battle tanks with a crew of two, and suffers not a scratch of damage. Unfortunately, it appears that the vehicle will occupy a major place in the stories, so it'll take a large does of ""suspension of belief"". There is some appendix-like material at the end of the book which discusses some of the technical issues, but to an unsatisfactory degree.As for the editing, it almost appears that the author simply published his first draft. This is not nit-picking, the errors are abundant to the point where they can disrupt the flow of reading, causing me to stop and re-scan a paragraph or even go back a page. Since I am reviewing the Kindle edition, I'm surprised that the author hasn't chosen to reissue a new edition. Technically it would cost nothing to reissue an e-book update, but then again, I'm not an author nor publisher, so I don't really know what's involved. Seeing as other people have mentioned the editing of this book, I know I am not alone in picking this up.All that aside, I've no doubt I will continue to explore this series, until either I run out of books to read, or I lose interest.

She is married to a baron who, based on the storytelling appears to be somewhat mentally abusive.  Her husband is an alcoholic and appears to have some emotional issues.  She is considered the most beautiful woman of her time and her husband likes to dress her as a strumpet when he has the occasional gentleman over.  The hero, Adam is an Earl who is ""lured"" to the castle for a pair of twin horses.  He meets Catherine and based on her looks, falls instantly in love with her.  The question to be answered is how can Catherine and Adam be together given that she is married?  Is it worth scandal for their love to blossom?As I read this book, I find several things incredulous.  First, this ""love"" between Catherine and Adam isn't really that well developed.  I can believe she loves him as she was forced into this marriage at 17 and has been secluded since that time, and Adam does not stare at her breasts that are so amply displayed by her husband.  He is kind and loving to her and teaches her about passion.  However, based on what was told in this story, I am at a loss regarding Adam's love.  Everything that is described sounds like the lust of a tremendously beautiful woman (think, Helen of Troy, Cleopatra, etc.).  I don't see how they had enough non-physical interaction for him to fall in love with more than her face and figure.The author shows Catherine as a sweet and compassionate person despite the lack of such she has received from her husband, but never directly to Adam.  Additionally, there was a scene where the men who were hoping to gain Catherine's favors (she never presented herself as a woman who would grant any) crashed another soiree when they learned that was where she was headed next.  I found this to be absurd.The villain of the story, Catherine's husband Edgar did not seem much of a villain once his story was told.  I would have liked to see more of his story early rather than later in the novel and if done right, perhaps I could have excused the adultery.Overall, I can't really recommend this novel unless someone doesn't care about infidelity.  I found this novel to be weak, the adultery aside and did not care enough about the hero and heroine.  Yes, I finished it because frankly, I wanted to know more about the husband and, was curious to know how the author would get us to the happy ending that is expected in these types of novels.  Despite the novel progressing to the point where Catherine and Adam could be together, the ending left a lot to be desired as well.  I will not be purchasing any additional novels by this author.","03 10, 2012",AHAVDM445MD1W,"Never without a book ""C.""",Romance and adultery are not the same thing,1331337600

Ms. Brunkhorst provides the reader with a love story so real, you feel as though you are a part of the drama. The  key setting is in Montana, Big Sky country in all of its majesty.  I related to the small town feel after spending two summers in Missoula, Montana.  Her main character, Chelesa also spent a week in Montana and hence the beginning her a romance with her husband. They make a loving and beautiful family. I loved all of the characters. Ms. Brunkhorst invents them as if she were a supreme being molding and shaping them. Her rich vocabulary and smooth writing style draws in a reader who enjoys utilizing their critical and logical thinking skills. Torn touches all five senses. The love scene may leave you breathless and it did me. Jake, Chelsea's kind-hearted husband is almost a perfect human being. Tyler Benson is awesome in mind, body and soul. Ms. Brunkhorst's secondary characters are as important as the main characters because of their reactions to the events as the story unfolds. These incidents captivate and shake up situations, making the rising action so meaningful. I love the manner in which Ms. Burkhorst inserts drama on top of drama but with flair and lacking confusion and many surprises that touch everyone in Torn in a powerful way. Torn's great ending placed a smile on my face and an indelible mark on my heart. Ms. Burkhorst is a writer to watch and I am a new fan.

This book reads like it was written as a senior  thesis college project. The main character is not named, but she is referred to as &#8220;She&#8221;, and this makes, Stopping the World, difficult to follow. Toward the end we are told the narrator (of atwoods book) is nameless. This ought to have been stated toward the beginning to eliminate  confusion. Then we are told the nameless narrator is a device to pull readers into the story:&#8220;Read as living myth, Margaret Atwood's fine novel becomes the nameless narrator's service to her community, which now includes us, the thoughtful reader.&#8221;It is difficult for readers to identify with a nameless narrator, but it is challenging for a writer to dare to do this.In this essay, a layered cake is used as the metaphor for the world and our perception of it. The icing represents our surface only existence. Only Shamans can break free to explore all the inner layers.  In the end we are encouraged to take the plunge into knowledge and awaken humanity to the fullness of existence.This book was a confusing book, (and probably also Atwood&#8217;s Surfacing book, which I did not read) which explains/applies the brilliant concepts which are clearly detailed in Joseph Campbell&#8217;s book, Hero of a Thousand Faces.

I wasn't sure what to expect when I got it, but upon reading the forward I was prepared for a wonderful historical novel. What I got was even better! I got a novel that was so based in fact and true stories that almost every encounter, every event, could be looked up and backed by historical fact. I did.I love a book that takes me so deep in the history of an event and makes it all so real that it sends me into research mode to verify things and learn more. This book did this in spades.

And Mr. Seiden never disappointed me, every part was true, from the Trench at Babi Yar, to the constant gun fire going on there by the Nazi's once they invaded Kiev. The fact that Soviet held countries, the Jews in particular, welcomed the German's as liberators from the prejudice, suppressive Communist party, only to find themselves in worse shape than they were before. The small bands of resistance fighters, turning into larger bands, the woods of Russia and the Russian weather providing the native fighters hiding places and advantages over the better equip German army. The pain of the bands too far away to heed the calls from the Warsaw Ghetto when they had their uprising Passover of 1943, and with each call they knew that no one was going to help them, not the closer resistance groups, not the allies, no one went the aid of these people that fought for over a month with no back up.The mob mentality of the people, turning on their neighbor's wasn't a surprise to me, having learned all this from a historical view point growing up more than 40 years after the fact, but in this author's writing I can see that it wasn't a surprise to him either, or his characters he writes about, having been pushed to the background, into slums, ignored by their government and spit up on by their peers over time, they expected it. The Pogrom's that the Church organized and the Government looked the other way during which they went in and massacred as many Jews as they could for centuries. What surprised them was the way the supposedly civilized German people treated them. The dislike and distrust of the Vatican and the Catholics in general, the people of the time had came through loud and clear in this work, but what came through also was the belief that people could go against what they had been taught all their life. By accepting some Genitals into their group, and trusting the fledgling groups location and plans to the couple that saved Solomon, and the Priest that spoke against the killings, and later sent Jews to them, and eventually joined them; yes, Mr. Seiden was able see all sides of the fallible humans that got caught in Hitler's quest for power and world domination.I give this book a rating of five solid stars, and am recommending it to any of my friends that have any type of interest in this area of history. Thank you for writing this book, and for giving me something new to learn about a time I thought I had pretty much exhausted all avenues on. I loved every part of this book, every death cut me, but I know it was war and it wasn't going to be pretty going into it. There wouldn't be roses and birds singing all through the story line, but they were there when it was most unexpected. A great tale very carefully and thoroughly researched and plotted out.

Louisa believes herself to be ugly, not just unattractive, but actually ugly. She hears the snickers when she enters a room, the horrible insults launched at her back as she passes by, and knows that no man truly wants her for anything more than her extensive dowry. When she encounters the dark stranger who lives in a cave, keeps to the shadows but whose soothing voice and demeanor intrigues, and attracts her, she soon learns that there is more to a person than what is reflected in the mirror, or in others' eyes. Douglas fears that trying to live in the world alongside those who are so different from him endangers all who cross his path. Soon he learns that whereas normal is a concept which all humans strive to obtain, no one is truly normal and he may be accepted for his differences more easily than he expects.This dark, sweet novella about love overcoming diversity and that beauty is in the eye of the beholder will keep you enthralled from the beginning moments, when Louisa discovers the cave home of Douglas to the reveal of his dark secret, a lovely dance in the moonlight, and their eventual happily-ever-after. I highly recommend reading A DANCE IN THE DARK by Karen Ranney for any number of reasons listed above, but mostly because it's just that good - in fact, I wish it had been longer.***Copy gifted as part of subscribing to author's newsletter.

Then I somehow bought the book on Amazon and started reading it.  It made me think about all the different times and ways in which Cinderella has been presented in my life. Naked men and satyrs and pirates never really entered into it before.My first Cinderella was, no doubt, a little Golden Book Version and in 1965 I remember my mom being really excited about a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical that was going to be on TV (CBS) with Lesley Ann Warren and Stuart Damon (you know him from General Hospital). Mom was excited about it because Celeste Holm, Ginger Rogers and Walter Pidgeon were in it. Lesley Ann Warren was a trained ballet dancer so that was going to add something. Perhaps my mother thought that would inspire me. I don't know, in ballet I always felt I had missed all the classes where we learned anything.Back then, in black and white on our thirteen-inch screen (which we had until 1972), it was magical. The music was great and I was transported. It did nothing for my career in the ballet school being taught in the fire station however.Then, in a service internship in college I interned at a state run theater and they ran Cinderella. Because it was the state we had all kinds of educational information around it. They discussed how the story was very old and they had traced it all the way to China.It certainly has had a lot of versions filmed and written throughout the years, I even saw that there is a Sin-derella from 1965. We also have the socio/psycho/anthrop-logical theories brought out of fairy tales. White knights, Peter Pan and uncomfortable shoes!What about this version of Cinderella? Queen Ella is now 31 and really horny since her Prince Charming turned into Prince Charles (ie. boring, unfaithful) and disappeared. The way she is described she reminds me of one of the Gabor sisters. She decides to hold a masquerade ball so she can find a sexual partner and incognito have sex with him.After she meets the man of her dreams at the ball but doesn't learn his name she decides to throw a second ball to find him. This time another fantasy is realized. After the second ball she realizes who her mystery lovers are. Forces, in the form of her mendacious step family in a neighboring kingdom conspire to keep them apart and bring back Prince Charming who is now a gay pirate.Will Ella and her mystery beau survive? Will Ella, Charming and his pirate lover get it on? Will Ella be cast out in disgrace? Or will they all live happily ever after?****This isn't so much a retelling as a sequel: Cinderella the Post-Charming Years.The intimate scenes are sexy even though I also found then icky. The sex wasn't terribly inventive. I had a hard time deciding if we were back in days of yore or in a post-industrial kingdom. They had a tub and bathroom with running water, but it did not seem they had cars or telephones.The book was highly predictable plot wise, although Prince Charming ending up being different than I thought he would be. It's possible I have read too many erotica books but I pretty much knew what would happen after the first 30 pages.Are there any redeeming qualities? Well Queen Ella comes off a mature,not dependent on men, and a good ruler with an egalitarian spirit. And, it isn't a retelling which was nice. The relationship between Ella and her beau is loving.I bought the Kindle version which was only $3.44. If I were to purchase a paperback I would, in all likelihood, buy something else. with the nearly $12 price tag.  Not great, not terrible.

There is a point in the middle of the book where he compares being hurt physically and being hurt emotionally and I really had to stop reading for a while, the emotion was so deep it seemed impossible for me to recover.I liked the slices we get of his job as a radio host. I would have liked to see something more, the phone callings he got were interesting.What I didn't like:* Will and Cobalt had each their set of problems. While Cobalt's resolution was completely satisfying, Will's resolution was perplexing to say the least, both regarding what leads to it and what the real consequences are. It sounded improbable.* In comparison to Will, Cobalt's character is more superficial, one-dimensional. On the other hand I felt that one of the secondary characters, Uriskel, with his bad reputation and dangerous mission, was far more interesting and I think I would appreciate him even more when I'll re-read the book.

This is more of Karen Traviss' mary-sue adventures of Boba Fett and the almighty, infallible, infinitely over-detailed and completely boring Mandalorians, who bear a strong resemblance to Scottish Highlanders in an average B-grade romance novel.It's stuff like this that makes me glad she has decided to stop writing Star Wars.As usual, Traviss throws out established canon to match her ideas and fit her story. This book is pointless, as the whole premise is flawed, based on a non-canon idea, and will be zapped out of existence once the T-Canon episodes of Clone Wars (which trump the C-Canon (soon to be S-Canon or N-Canon) ideas in Traviss' books.)Traviss has managed to take one of the coolest characters in the Star Wars universe and turn him into one of the most annoying, uninteresting, boring, obnoxious, mary-sue characters ever written. She took the quiet cool of Boba Fett, and turned him into a character who just Wouldn't Shut Up. She took Mandalorians and turned them from an elusive, lost, dying race of people who were cooler for having been scattered across the galaxy, into a clan of dancing, singing, Mando'a speaking, boastful morons whose place in canon is now a convoluted mess.And don't get me started on how plodding and over-detailed her writing is. If you want to know every tiny, minuscule, stupid thing about a character, just turn to Traviss' books. You're lucky if she doesn't tell you how, when, and where Boba acquired his underwear, and what they're made of.Suffice it to say, I'm not a fan of Traviss' work. I consider her Star Wars books to be a notch below Barbara Hambly's disastrous efforts. Read this only if you're a huge fan of Traviss, or a huge fan of Non-Canon Star Wars books...

I liked the two characters, Max and Hunter. They were sweet and fun. The story was another ""straight guy goes gay"" story. Those can be fun, but often feel very contrived to me. This one was fairly light on plot, too. There was a lot of exploration of, primarily, Hunter's feelings and fears, but no real conflict. It was also kind of sweet that Max could read Hunter so well, but at times it seemed almost intrusively psychic when he'd take one look at Hunter and say something extremely specific that exactly addressed whatever bit of angst Hunter was feeling at the moment.

Nearly every story herein is some sort of ghost story, but it's less ""The Grudge"" and more ""here are some ghosts, they have some unfinished business, but they're trapped, sorta, and that's sad I guess?"" It should be said, naturally, that horror is entirely subjective, and what one person finds scary another will find boring, but all of the stories within Ashes don't actually seem to be trying to be scary, unless all of the writers have some sort of different definition of the word than I do.The problem with most of them is that they seem to lack any real point... there is rarely any sort of resolution, usually only a sort of token conflict, and most of them just kind of peter out with an ""oh well"" sort of vibe. One story, revolving around a pregnant woman abandoned on a farm, actually felt pointless, confusing, and downright silly to the point where I actually went back over it to see if I was missing something, or if a few pages had stuck together.

7621,618,B000R93D4Y,"[11, 12]",3,"Reading the reviews before purchasing this, the first in the series, I was shocked at the negative responses.  I have always enjoyed Bianca's work, so it was out of character to see such reviews.Based on my past experience with her work, combined with my love of dragons, I decided to give the series a shot.  Granted, there is a lot of sex, but this is to be expected for the genre Bianca writes in.  This is an adult romance story & not for kids, which I read as a complaint in a few of the reviews.  How anyone could think otherwise, I have no idea, as it's obvious in the description this book contains sexual situations.Also, many reviewers commented on dragon-human sex.  I did not see this at all, rather the dragons matings affect their human-bonded warriors; I saw nothing untoward about this.  The reviewers made it sound as if the dragons and humans were having sex.  Nothing could be further from the truth.If you know this is an erotic story, with frequent sexual scenes, then you should know what to expect.  As for the story, I found I enjoyed the characters.  The dragons had a surprising amount of humanity, which I enjoyed.  The warriors were strong, capable, sexy men.  There were a lot of sex scenes, no question.  I would have enjoyed the story a lot more if there was more to the story than sex, as not much occurred beyond their meeting and mating until the very end.Bianca has always had wonderful world and character building, with a great plot.  This story lacked the complexity of her normal writing for me, thus the three star rating.  Other than this, I found the reviews to be unfounded.The best advice I can give regarding this story is, if you have enjoyed this Author's writing, you will likely like this, more for the potential as a continuing series than for this story specifically.  If you have no experience with this Author, I would recommend not judging all of her work based off of this story.  Her work, as a whole is incredible.As an Author myself, I know we don't always hit a home run.  It's not a bad story, it's simply not her best work.  However, I am excited for the future of this series, as I see the potential exists for amazing stories to come.  As I write this review, I believe she is on the seventh book of the series.I would suggest, if it sounds interesting, or like something that may interest you, give it a try.  Do not let the negative reviews alter your opinions of the Author, her work as a whole, or this story in specific.  To do so would be an injustice to a very creative and successful Author.As for me, because I see the potential in the series, I will purchase the next book and see for myself.  I have faith in this Author's writing abilities enough to spend three dollars and change for a chance to see where she takes the series.Also, there were several remarks made of the positive reviews being made all by paid reviewers.  To clarify, as an Author we do not pay reviewers, or pay for reviews.  People who review books are provided with an ARC (advanced reader's copy) so they can read & review prior to publication date.  This is done for many reasons, some being for the benefit of the reader (so they have an opinion to read on a new book), others for the Author (so they can get first-hand feedback early on from people who do nothing but read in their genre).Making an accusation of paying for reviews is harsh, unfounded and discredits the Author, reviewer, and the entire process.  We have no need to pay for reviews, and it would be a vast waste of (what little) resources and time we have.  After all, when the book hits the market, if the reading public does not like it, no amount of positive reviews from reviewers will change this.Also, I would like to point out the fact that most Authors have no say in which reviewers their book is sent to, as this is often a decision made and completely handled by the publisher.  As an Author, I am given so many copies of my book to distribute, but these are used for promotional purposes only (like a contest).  I am not allowed to distribute these books to reviewers.  This is in my contract.  So, to this end, making a claim of paying for reviews again has no foundation.I know this explanation has nothing to do with the story itself, but I felt it necessary to clarify, based off of some (poor) reviews, and their comments.  Especially given, if your profession is not that of an Author, you would likely not know how reviewers are handled.In ending, I'm off to purchase the next in the series; I know Bianca's writing, and I am confident she will take this series in great directions.Enjoy!  =)Shelbie Knightwww.shelbieknight.com","06 11, 2013",A1ZAPFF4YQ4IPJ,"Shelbie Knight ""Shelbie Knight =)""",Make your own decision,1370908800

I get that sequels are for people who have read the first book, but a little backstory never hurt anyone. There is *none* in this book, and given that it's free, I think there should have been an expectation that this would be peoples' introduction to the series.So, anyway, Holly is eight months pregnant, and 'married' to three brothers who won't have sex with her because they're afraid of hurting her, or the baby.Eventually she manages to convince (i.e. corner and threaten with 'the wrath of a hormonal woman') two of the brothers, and have sex with them. Only one of these sex scenes appear in the book, the other fades to black.Eventually, she has the baby and everyone ends up happily ever after. The description of the birth is a little...graphic for my taste. I would much rather have read about that second sex scene than listen to one of the brothers try to make sure Holly had passed the placenta *shudder*What's really irritating, is the extract at the end of this book is intriguing, but because of the lack of characterisation, backstory and world-building (I know it's not fantasy, but there is zero description of Holly's location and surroundings), means I won't read that book.I only finished this book because it was mercifully short, and I would have felt very guilty giving up on a short story.","04 9, 2012",A1OK2B6G8FNYFM,CharlotteSimmons,"Poorly written, no backstory or characterisation",1333929600
6000,4850,B002CZQ7XK,"[0, 1]",3,"Overall, I enjoyed this book but it wasn't all that original.  The writing was good, which is something I've come to treasure in today's market, when anyone can publish their poorly written slop without much difficulty and even best selling authors from major publishing houses are suffering a lack of editing.  For that reason alone, I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes paranormal/Gothic romance.If you're not looking for characters with depth or a plot with surprising twists, you'll probably enjoy this book.There were two things that I didn't like.  (SPOILER ALERT!)  First, the way the love scenes were written gave me the impression that this author isn't really comfortable writing about sex.  When the hero and heroine made love for the first time, the tone suddenly became weirdly formal, with lines like ""It seemed imperative that their bodies meet without hindrance..."" which sort of killed the mood for me.  There were also so many flagrant metaphors (""He stirred her...like waves of a storm""; ""They poised on the edge of a volcano..."") that I totally missed the ghostly elements during that scene because I thought it was just more metaphor.  It was only at the end of the scene, when the characters started talking about what had just happened, that I even understood what the author was trying to portray.Second, I'm a retired professional musician who also has a degree in psychology, and unfortunately, this author tried to portray both a musician character and a character who suffers mental problems without doing enough research into either area.  Most people who lack my background might not notice, but for me, these flaws were glaring.  I'm not certain how this author came up with her information, but it was both inaccurate and outdated.  I realize it's nerdy to expect writers to do a little basic research before they start typing, but this kind of sloppiness tends to ruin books for me.  I can handle a bit of poetic license, but this went beyond that, straight into the realm of lazy disregard for plausibility.One other complaint: most ebooks allow the reader to jump between chapters.  This one didn't, making it very difficult to move through the book if I wanted to go back and check something I'd read before--something I often do while reading a book which involves some sort of mystery.  This really annoyed me, more than the occasion errors in the formatting did.If you're not too picky and don't expect too much, you'll probably enjoy this book.  It's not a bad way to kill an afternoon if you have nothing better to do.","06 2, 2013",A1Y68IEVYH6HM4,Sea Laughing,Predictable Fare for Ghost Lovers,1370131200

Him and his people have been cavorted and in slaved by the lizard aliens to mine the astroid/ship.

The Zorn must fight and the winner gets her. Ral wins and takes her to his room caveman style where they have hot sex. Then he starts saying that she is his. &#8220;I think you don not understand.

Don't let the first few pages put you off- it actually gets even better.This was a very quick read, and was a fascinating mixed bag for me, but one I enjoyed. I will admit to finding the speed at which the lust blossoms to be off-putting. It felt almost like cheap sex at first, but events that occurred midway into the story provide the necessary distance and depth.The characters ended up being very well developed. As another reviewer mentioned, the opening chapter can give the impression that this will be just another silly vamp romance with no substance. While it certainly isn't DEEP, the characters are well rounded.(As an aside, Ms. Byrne absolutely NAILED a psychologically abusive relationship that gave our heroine some issues to work through. It was so well captured, it gave me shivers.)The mythology is pretty standard vampire stuff- nothing fancy. The paranormal side of this story is relatively low key, but well utilized. The vampirism makes for some highly erotic moments and adds just a little spice to the romance. There isn't a lot of magic or mystery, though.The only other issue I really had with this story is the ending. It just ends. WHAM. Over- lights out, no reading under the covers. It felt a little like someone shut off the TV before that final scene of the show where you get that final sense of closure and all ends are tied off. It is abrupt and doesn't feel quite complete.In the end, I look forward to reading more in this series. This one, especially with that ending, felt like a tease, just a taste of things to come. It will be fun to see not just more characters in this world Ms. Byrne has created, but also how her writing continues to grow. She has a very natural style that lends itself to well developed characters. Hopefully she will give them a little more time and room in her upcoming stories.ADDITIONAL READS: More light vampire centric romance...Marta Acosta'sHappy Hour at Casa DraculaR.G.

Even before the author stopped writing in this series - she had switched to only publishing novella's that were side stories and not part of the ongoing story.  I would definitely not recommend that anyone purchase what is now listed as #7 - Never A Slave because it does not add anything to the unfinished series.The novels are okay but go into it with your eyes wide open and with the understanding that there will be no resolution to the mystery or the missing girls after the 5th book.

For some reason I had expected something way more intense since there seems to be so much buzz about the Lords of the Underworld series. To me the writing seemed kind of amateurish. I'm going to give the rest of the books a chance though because I did buy The Darkest Fire as part of a Lords of the Underworld bundle package and I am curious on the relevance of this prequel.Regarding the hero in the story, as admirable as Geryon was, the description of hooves, fur and horns was a big turn off. I just wasn't feeling the draw at all. Even creepy as he seemed more animal than human.The idea that Pandora's box was built from a Goddess' bones was really cool and I think that I may have enjoyed The Darkest Fire more if I had read it after the first book in the series, The Darkest Night. Perhaps I could have appreciated the importance of Pandora's box more. As for the The Darkest Fire being a stand alone little story; I'd not suggest reading it alone and then giving up. More forward with The Darkest Night and then make your decision if you liked it or not. Since I went ahead and read The Darkest Night right away, that moved my rating for this book from a 2 to a 3.

But when Kerri and Mitch are out one night sharing a friendly drink, she tells him she wants to marry and asks Mitch to introduce her to some single, eligible men. There's nothing Mitch wouldn't do for Kerri, but her request bothers him. A lot.As she starts to date the guys he reluctantly introduces her to, he gets more and more uncomfortable and tension rises in their friendship. Soon the friendly quips between them that used to be teasing fun take on more bite and a decade long friendship goes from smooth to rocky. Tensions and tempers rise between them. Pushed to the brink, a fight between them ends in a kiss - a wild, tempestuous kiss that changes everything...but solves nothing. Can two friends accept the fact that they're made for each other or will the differences between them kill their friendship and destroy the chance for love?Despite the fact that the friends-turned-lovers theme is one of my favorites in contemporary romance, I had way too many problems with this book to be charmed. The plot was two dimensional and predictable, the narrative lacked sophistication, the dialogue lacked conversational flow, and the characters lacked charm.The characters were the biggest problem. More specifically, Kerri. Mitch had little to recommend him as a romantic lead, but he wasn't overly objectionable, despite an unhealthy anger management issue or two. Kerri, on the other hand, I found to be utterly contemptible. She blames Mitch for everything that goes wrong in their relationship, takes no responsibility for her own actions or feelings on any matter, flits between wildly contradictory emotions at a blink, is pathologically immature, and is grievously self involved. I may not have warmed up to Mitch, but I actively disliked Kerri.The romance started to improve towards the end, but ended up floundering when the dialogue took a turn for the worse. Two comments in particular stick in my mind, at the turning point for the relationship between Mitch and Kerri, Mitch says the following:""I want to be with you, and most of all, I don't want anyone else to be with you.You think you need a husband? Fine, then - it's going to be me.""You want kids and I want them to be mine. Nobody else's.""Neither one of those comments come anywhere near my idea of romance, nor do they inspire a lot of confidence in the relationship. Mitch comes off seeming less interested in being with Kerri because he loves her and more interested in making sure that she's not with anyone else. Admittedly, these comments are taken out of context, but they provide examples of the problems I had with the dialogue.On the positive side, Jamieson writes very sensual, erotic sex scenes. The naked yoga in particular was a sultry, seductive delight, and as a whole the sex was very well done and provided the best written scenes in the book.

Also for some reason : ""Do you want me to drink your come?"" when characters are talking about whether it is okay to come in another guy's mouth makes me laugh and not in a good way.Everything just felt artificial and wooden in this story. The whole set up of bringing Seth to Gray's house just made zero sense to me. And of course they both liked women a lot, just before this encounter that is.And yes Gray tried really really hard not to make a pass on Seth... not. All his angst felt just so wierd because he gave in so fast.I barely avoided giving my Kindle a flying workout when I was done with this story.","07 9, 2012",A19GJX6TTSK0C0,Sirius,Horrendous,1341792000

2361,8345,B002VFPSD6,"[2, 8]",1,"Welome to the negative review of the book everyone else loved.Let's begin shall we.I will start with the plot. When I was first reading the synopsis the plot sounded intriguing, and I loved the idea of the disgraced book hunter, and the lost Dickens story, but for some reason it ended up not working for me. I think that sex was introduced too early on, and was a distraction from what I liked about the idea of the book rather than something that added to the story.I liked James for the most part, and was able to sympathize with his plight. Losing the job he loved, and the security in his world must have been terrible, and, having worked retail, understand how frustrating, exhausting, and dehumanizing that can be. Added to the stress of trying to make ends meet on part time work without any sort of benefits, it's no wonder why he does what he does.Sedgwick, on the other hand, I never developed any affection for. I found him to be blunt to a point beyond simple rudeness, and his excuses seemed liked those of a child rather than a 42 year old man who should be old enough to understand proper behavior, or at least how to make a sincere apology for his words. I found his behavior, after he and James had a falling out, to be almost stalker like, and added to that he seems to almost bully James into hearing him out, and accepting his half hearted apology. He is also described as having a full beard, which is not my thing, and with all the scenes of both men eating had me truly grossed out imagining all the crumbs it must collect (this is not meant as a slight to any of my friends who have or enjoy beards, it's just not my thing.)For me the worst part of this book was the sex. This book had some of the hands down worst written sex scenes I've ever read, and let me tell you I have read some truly terrible sex scenes. Let's go to the book for some examples shall we.""Like a suede glove grabbing me, stroking me..Like a hot black fist.""What the hell is that supposed to mean, and why a black fist?""The pump and pull was like a hammer striking the golden frames of angel wings, pounding them into shining, glinting pennons. Perspiration sheened our bodies and our breath grew harsher as we bent our backs and worked the forge, and then the wings began to beat, trying to take flight, moving faster and faster, and we seemed to lift right off the ground, right off the pillows, and bedding, and hang there transfixed as warm, white Halle-fricking-lujah surged through.And then we dropped back to earth, wet, winded and weak. Human again.""Seriously what in the name of pink plastic ponies did I just read? I had to look up what a pennon was because I had no idea. Merriam-Webster was kind enough to tell me it ""a long usually triangular or swallow-tailed streamer typically attached to the head of a lance as an ensign"" which only made the sentence even more of a mystery to me because it sounded like the author was alluding to something that would be forged, like something made out of metal, say a sword, but the word he used meant something made of cloth. Color me confused. It's also some of the sappiest, most awkwardly written sex I've even read, and that's including the het 80's romance I read in high school. Nothing about this works for me on any level, and that's not the only angel reference during sex there is.""It was like landing on a cloud - with an angel on top of me. An angel that tasted like cinnamon and chocolate and stardust.""Really, exactly how old are these characters supposed to be because it sounds more like some child's fantasy of sex rather than real, adult sex. Sedgwick has some sort of whipped chocolate cr&egrave;me brulee body cream souffl&eacute; that only adds to my impression of them as much younger than they really are.My least favorite of the sex scenes has to be the one I included in my updates, but it bears repeating.""and it was sadly like a hood over the head of an angel, but better safe than sorry.The angel continued to blindly feel its way to the hot, candy-slick center hovering tentatively above it.There is nothing about that I find sexy, and ""candy-slick"" I guess I don't find candy to be very slick. I think of candy more as sticky which makes this analogy all that less appealing to me.In summary I will say I found the sappy, miracle ending to be the final straw. If things had been toned down quite a bit, and the characters' relationship allowed to develop at a more natural pace I might have enjoyed this book. Had the mystery of the Dickens story played a more significant role, and the sex scenes cut back I would have happily given this at least three stars. Alas this was not to be.","03 21, 2013",A30LBR2VOXBST7,"MLE ""Omnivorous reader""",Purple prose and bad romance,1363824000

1682,30046,B0046H9ZF4,"[1, 2]",2,"To begin with, let's say that this book is cheap: 2.90$ for 290 pages. And the author knows her English spelling and grammar (no mistake found).I think a lot of people who are not sure they like the idea of &#8203;&#8203;slavery, even consensual, will love this book. But I did not like it.There are several inconsistencies early in the story, so I was not really hooked.* Gavin, the main character, is against slavery, but he works as a trainer of slaves for Cascade, a company that trains and sells slaves.* It is said in the story that Alex (the second protagonist) is the first applicant slave that Gavin trains who really wants to become a slave. His previous slaves in training were young paupers who had not found other ways to get out of their misery than offering themselves as slaves to Cascade. However, Gavin, who is by his own admission, against slavery, trained them all without moral issues. But when he meets Alex, he decides that he is the one he must rescue from slavery and protect him against the kinky owners who want to buy him.* Gavin, who is revolted at the idea of &#8203;&#8203;slave owners who do not take into consideration the needs or desirse of the slaves, takes no account of the firm and deliberate decision of Alex to become a slave. He seeks for 250 pages to discourage Alex from becoming a slave and he refrains from treating Alex as hard as he did previously with the other young slaves that he trained. Which, incidentally, makes the story very dull since the desire of Gavin to go easy with Alex prevents the story from developing interesting BDSM elements.* Gavin treats Alex as if he were a child unable of making his own decisions, but Alex is 47 years old.* When Gavin asks Alex at the beginning of the story how he feels about pain, Alex, who nevertheless met many times sadistic potential buyers before going to register with Cascade, said to be terrified of the pain and not know what he feels about it. And as soon as the first time Gavin strikes him, Alex is supremely excited by what Gavin does to him. How could a forty-seven-year-old guy not realize until then that the pain excited him? Mystery!* Alex--who already knows very well Brian (slave owner) and Rhys (the slave of Brian) to have experienced BDSM scenes with them many times--feels compelled to give his name to Cascade to be able to live that same sort of BDSM things that Brian and Rhys offered him. Why is he not remained free and did he not continued his BDSM relationship with Brian and Rhys if it was sufficiently satisfactory that he wants Brian to buy him? Cascade was absolutely not necessary.Anyway, the story drags on. There is only one real BDSM scene in the 240 pages of the book (because of Gavin desire to ""protect"" Alex and to go gently with him). The main part of the book is a little rough sex scenes. There are too many sex scenes for my taste. So if you are looking for BDSM, just read the last 50 pages, where Gavin finally smartened a bit and decided to show his true nature.Even if the author knows the English grammar pretty well, it does not mean that she is a great author. There is no description of sensations in this novel: no smell, no tactile sensations, no taste. There are very few descriptions of feelings (emotion). We know that Gavin is in love with Alex only because the author shows how possessive he is and that he is nervous at public meetings between Alex and potential buyers.It made me think to a novel that Sade wrote while he was in jail. Nothing in his novel described the sensations either, as Sade could not live what he imagined since he was in jail at that time. Here, the author--a lot less sadistic than Sade (by the way, Sade was a masochist too, his servant dominated him from time to time)--probably did not live much of what she describes as she is unable to attach all the feelings that go with it.In summary, I forced myself to finish this book. But I skipped many pages describing sex scenes and I only browsed several other pages in which the author was only describing the guilty conscience of Gavin and his issues with the idea of &#8203;&#8203;owning a slave (he thinks to buy Alex ). Up to the 7/8 of the book, Gavin still asks Alex if he really wants to become a slave! He had asked him that same question a million times already and the answer was always an enthusiastic ""YES!"". So, I had enough of this mental torture and I read several pages diagonally. I was glad when I eventually got to the last page.I give two stars because of the quality of the writing (no mistake found) and because there is a few good pages (the last 50 pages), but this is the maximum that I can give to this novel.","11 24, 2012",A3BHELCHN1N9YG,Danny,"Cheap, but not so good",1353715200
8961,27122,B0042JSSE0,"[22, 23]",2,"MATE SET by Laurann Dohner.STORY BRIEF:Most humans are unaware that werewolves are living in their community.  Mika is a human who was adopted by Omar's sister.  She knows Omar is a werewolf and keeps the secret.  She lives in California but visits Omar for a few weeks a year.  Omar loves her and is protective of her.  This year she unknowingly visits during werewolf mating season.  Large numbers of werewolves visit the area and will rape her if they get the chance.  Omar asks Grady to live with Mika for two weeks to protect her from the males. Grady is sexually drawn to Mika but won't touch her because of her uncle's threats.  A rival clan member wants Mika and tells Grady he will take her unless she is marked by Grady.  To avoid a werewolf war and save Mika, Grady is forced to mark her.  Now that she is marked he must have frequent sex with her or go insane.  She likes it.REVIEWER'S OPINION:This was pretty good at the start.  I liked the following conversation (at 380).  Omar's girlfriend Minnie is talking.  ""I was mated when I was younger and it sucked.  Being mated pretty much makes you a damn slave that a mated man thinks he owns lock, stock, and barrel.  He orders you around and treats you like property because you are his.  It's in their damn blood when they mate to take it to the extreme.""  I also liked a cute scene in which Omar is going to assign a guard to Mika based on which man looks at her body the least.  Mika didn't want a guard so she dressed as sexy as possible.  This caused some gaping expressions.But as the story progressed I became more and more disappointed.  The main conflicts between the two were based on inaccurate assumptions and vague communication.  Mika was falling in love with Grady, but he didn't reciprocate.  Mika felt rejected because she knew he wanted a werewolf for a mate.  She was angry at Grady for various ""assumed"" reasons.  The major conflict causing her to leave was based on hearing Grady talk about someone else and thinking he was talking about her.  When Grady tried to explain she refused to listen.  In fact she threatened him with something if he even talked to her.  Thus he was forced to be quiet and not explain anything.  This was such a cheap device to extend the conflict I was angry.  It overshadowed the good writing from earlier in the book and I had to lower the stars.  There was an odd scene near the end with Grady's brother wanting Mika.  I wasn't sure if this was true or if he was trying to make Grady jealous.  That felt thrown in and not developed enough by the author.I would have preferred the author show how Grady's feelings change during the book.  We don't see how or why he fell in love with Mika.  We do know he didn't want her in the beginning - other than for sex.The sex scenes were pretty good.  There were a lot of them.DATA:Ebook story length: about 3  hours.

Billionaire older brother kidnaps the wrong sister when he tries to save his playboy younger brother from making a big ""mistake.""  If you've ever read any Harlequin books, this premise will be very familiar.  However, whereas Harlequin books are edited and the plot generally follows in a concise manner, this book was unedited and all over the place in terms of character development, plot development, and writing style.I won't reiterate what many of the other posters stated regarding the incorrect and ubiquitous use of the word ""had.""  It starts in Chapter One and continues until the end.  Having been forewarned, I didn't try to make sense of it when I first came across it.  Because, when you first see the incorrect use of ""had"" you wonder if the character is having a flashback or something.  Then you realize, no, we are not going back in time; the author just didn't take any writing classes.  I ended up not even reading the ""had"" and automatically changing the sentence structure in my mind as I read it.So why is this a Harlequin book gone bad?  Because so much of the plot and characters just reeks of the typical Harlequin plot, but without the Harlequin delivery.  So much so, that it makes me wonder if this author was an avid Harlequin reader who one day decided to try her own hand at writing.  And I say this because I've read so many books that I've thought maybe I can write one too.  Only to realize that there is big difference between editing/critiquing/reviewing, and actually authoring a book.  As the other posters stated, an editor would have done this book a great deal of service.  Aside from the ""had"" issue, a good editor could have pointed out that the plot does not flow naturally, that the characters are just not developed enough (either make them very basic cookie cutter characters, or really flush them out), and just the general movement of the plot is entirely unbelieveable.Example: After kidnapping Diona, Nikias spends time with her going snorkeling and showing her around his island, etc., etc.  Now, if he was really the ruthless b**#$%&d; that the author tries to convey him as, then he would have completely ignored her while he continued with his own playboy ways.  I also find it unbelieveable that this brilliant self-made shipping tycoon didn't do the basic investigation necessary to know that Daryle had an older sister who was a nurse.  If you're going to spy on little brother, then do it properly.I'm glad the book was free, otherwise I would have felt ripped off. In fact, I still feel that the author should be paying the reviewers for the free editing critiques that we offer.","08 20, 2012",A77DYZSK06F2M,Picky User,Harlequin book that HAD gone bad,1345420800

My interest in the story actually perked up on the assassination attempts that's how flat I found the romance.  The story got really weird with the menage and the admitted orgies between mated partners - really turned me off as it cheapened the whole idea of a true mate.

I really couldn't get a feel for how these characters looked---the author didn't paint a vivid picture for me.  In addition, I felt that the story wasn't well told.  So many details were lacking, especially the history of Sydney and Tyler's relationship.  What happened for them to break up? Had he always been crazy?  How did she not see this before?  For her to be such a feisty girl, why couldn't she have dealt with Tyler better?  I was not impressed with her hiding from him and nearly allowing him to rape her without much fight: ""At least she wouldn't be awake for it.""Now, let's talk about chemistry in the book.  The chemistry is quite tepid.  Sydney and Tyler kiss a bit, she gives him advice, they flirt, then they're headed to his hotel for sex. What??? I really would have preferred the book without the ONE sex scene. It was horrible.  The lackluster description of the sex is so vague I had to read it twice to be sure I was actually in the midst of a love scene!  This is definitely what I was expecting from a Wild Ride story, but then, I thought this author was comparable to Cat Johnston and Lorelei James.  Boy, was I wrong.  Even more frustrating, at the end of the book, I was surprised that Levi wanted a permanent commitment to Sydney.  Why?

Everything happens in one long sentence and at that point you have to go on to find out what happens next.The story is about an American who is forced to work for a Mexican gang who traffics drugs across the border with the United States. You see the character's ascent from common man, who must count on his expertise to make himself indispensable to his new ""boss"", thus avoiding his own death and that of her daughter, to expert trafficker and unscrupulous criminal.The rhythm is that an action story, but the suspense is typical of a thriller. While accompanying the character to his descent into hell, one wonders how he will ever get out of that situation, and from time to time our theories are proved wrong by the latest turn of events.The very title of ""Borderline Case"" has the double meaning of referring to a geographical border and to a borderline patient, emphasizing the dual reading of the story.Although told in third person, in fact, the novel follows almost exclusively the main character, Eric, except for some scenes, so you end up deeply understanding and sympathizing for him. The other characters are almost all portrayed in a rather superficial way, perhaps deliberately not to distract too much the reader from the main problem (the survival of Eric) and make sure they won't mind if they got killed. Which happens often.If it were a movie in theaters, I would say that the ticket costed very little, if the price is divided by the number of deaths. And this aspect, if we talk about drug trafficking and especially action, is undoubtedly positive.Really an excellent reading.Rita Carla Francesca Monticelli, author ofRed Desert - Point of No Return","05 11, 2012",A3RMCZMUUTFXSB,"Anakina ""Rita Carla Francesca Monticelli""",Action and fun,1336694400

3354,8915,B002YQ2JEI,"[7, 21]",1,"I confess it's difficult to convey in a few short words just how utterly bad this novel really is!The premise is certainly sound enough and, frankly, that's what prompted me to pick up this. The second coming of the Christian Messiah is at hand as a result of the deeply undercover cloning of Christ's DNA from blood recovered from the Shroud of Turin by a group of religious separatists known as the Vinces.THE SON OF MAN is clearly Christian fiction and one doesn't have to hunt very hard to see the clear parallels to the biblical story of the birth of God's son - the nativity star is represented by a rogue asteroid on a collision path with earth; the immaculate conception is presented via the impregnation of illegally cloned cells into a young virgin; the trek to Bethlehem is re-created as the struggle to reach Omaha, Nebraska, the anticipated ground zero of the collision with the asteroid; and the gift-bearing magi make an appearance as a kindly doctor and a Nobel Laureate physicist. There's even a John the Baptist character who ensures that nothing stands in the way of the birth of ""the Father's only begotten son"".I'll hand one kudo (and one kudo only) to CW Johnson. He definitely has the writing chops to create first rate suspense when it comes to describing the impending apocalypse that would be caused by collision of a mountainous asteroid with the heartland of America. Frankly, that's the only reason I actually finished this dog-eared mutt. But that's it! From a purely writing point of view, the plot is seriously disjointed and outrageously difficult to follow, sub-plots are willy-nilly injected and summarily dropped and the characters are cartoonish and thinly developed. Maria, for example, the stand-in for the mother of Christ on this second stab at converting the world, is a virgin only because she's a neurotic, egocentric,waspish whiner that no self-respecting man would stay with long enough to roll into bed.If one examines this novel from a thematic point of view, the theology is a joke and is an excellent example of the many reasons why I am a rabidly anti-Christian deist hanging tentatively by my fingernails on the edge of atheism. (And I know I'm not alone) That a self-centered, narcissistic God would make a second appearance to the world because we screwed up the receipt of his first message and failed to give him his due obeisance; that he would choose to make his appearance through the worldly efforts of a renegade group of arrogant theologians convinced that the end justifies their illegal means; that he would enlist a pederast, murderers, thugs, drug runners and extortionists as his advance earthly agents; that this so-called God would create havoc, mayhem, destruction, heartbreak, chaos and the foundation for a world-wide nuclear war as the climate for his second coming ... well, it's all more than laughable. It's the reason why there is so much antipathy today toward organized religion in general and Christianity in particular.If that's the God that Christian dogma has on offer, then give me the apocalypse but leave me alone after I'm dead and gone. That's one God that I don't care to ever meet.Paul Weiss","05 28, 2012",A3E8QNDC7CV44,Paul Weiss,That this represents a major world religion is a terrifying reality!,1338163200

I enjoy characters who are older than 25 and have minimal sexual experience- not every woman out there sleeps with every date or boyfriend or has a wild period in their early 20's. I like a male lead who realizes that he is ready to settle and he sees something in woman who isnt on the prowl or overtly sexual. Annabelle was worthwhile to him and he was prepared to work to gain her trust and to see herself the way he did.Components of a book are present: beginning, middle, end, conflict and climax, a good editor, and an author who understand how to tell a story.

I am not a big fan of the novella form- characters are usually one dimensional, stories seem rushed or overly simplistic and a little bit of background can read as dry as a law review when you are anxious to get back to the story. So I went into this expecting that. In the end, I found it didn't manage to avoid falling into those pitfalls, but I found I was pleased to have been introduced to the mythology of this world.This one was a little bit better than many novellas- the imagery is beautiful. Anyone who has spent time in a jungle would appreciate it. Very magical setting.The characters were not developed at all- I barely managed to put together a mental image of what they might look like, but the sex was hot and their attraction was palpable. Maggie and Brandt were likable enough, though you had to work hard to overlook his blatant deception that set off the whole thing. For the sake of the novella form, a reasonable back and forth between the two that would have allowed the relationship to develop had to be sacrificed. In places the passion short circuited rational thought, but Ms. Feehan managed to maintain the integrity of both characters.The best part of this, as I mentioned, was the mythology. Ms. Feehan has created a wonderful concept here. The environmental message was laid on a little thick, but overall it was a good concept to quickly win the heart of the reader.Anyone who is familiar with Ms. Feehan's work will recognize this isn't her best work, but it is a fast read that opens a door to a series that has great potential for passion.","09 5, 2010",AQNXEOJ4RPCGW,A.

This was such a moving and thought provoking story to be aimed at a younger audience but I think older readers would enjoy it too. William Woodall really gets into the mind of a 14 year old boy. What I like about this author is that he's not trying to be like anyone else. He's not copycating C.S. Lewis like so many others try to do. He's not afraid to approach the Christian aspect but he doesn't beat anyone over the head with it either.  His work is unique and I really enjoy it.I think he should have included discussion questions at the end of this book because there are so many ways to start a conversation with the many themes it contains.I would give the writing 4 stars only because the characters weren't as distinct as in other books I have read by this author. For instance, the names Brandon and Brian were so similar I kept confusing them. I thought the two main characters could have used something in their speech to set each one apart. I really enjoyed the unique way he has of putting things though. Here's an example.""Nor did he dream, except the sweet and simple dreams of the pure at heart, of the kind that nourish the soul but are never remembered.""I should also mention that the writing reminded me of a bedtime story in places. Some people might find that a bit distracting but I felt it added to the fairy-tale fantasy feel. I give the story line 5 whole stars. I'm sure someone has written about similar things but this felt original to me.The Christian aspect I'd give 5 stars also. It is very appropriate for the intended YA audience but also appealing to a much wider age range. I could see reading this book in a homeschool setting. I guess because there are so many nuggets of truth hidden in there. It's about Heaven. It's about bad things happening for a reason. It's about deciding for yourself what matters most in life.

The story reminded me a bit of a cross between ""Andromeda Strain"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" but in fact it's neither. In ""Andromeda Strain,"" the action takes place primarily at a remote laboratory where scientists study the alien organism that has infected and killed most of a small town's population. In ""Peculiar, MO,"" the action is in the town itself and centers around the organism's effects on the local people and a biological terrorism military unit that is studying the alien organism and trying to limit its spread. The tension grows steadily as the unit's scientist comes to the terrifying realization that the organism is attempting to invade the earth, not just infect it.The author's scientific explanation of the mechanism by which the alien plasmids (short strands of DNA) could use earth's plants and animals, including humans, to regenerate the alien species and rebuild its group consciousness and memory is quite detailed. I don't remotely have enough science background to know how plausible this is, but it was a fascinating concept that was more credible than the typical aliens-invade-human-bodies stories. I'll give the author a lot of credit for originality.The author builds the story around several characters. The principal characters, including Kelly Ross, Spencer Dale, and the mysterious John Gordon, are likable, well developed three-dimensional characters. There are some bad guys too, and the author kills them off in some very satisfying (i.e., gruesome) ways.As another reviewer noted, the military unit involved in the story was very small and was led by a non-commissioned officer, with privates doing most of the work. This wasn't very realistic, since the government had already dealt with a previous meteor strike that contained the alien plasmids, so the potential danger was recognized. I'm guessing that the author's reasoning was that a larger unit, such as a battalion, would have brought too much attention from the local people. In any case, this is a fairly minor quibble.Having read other stories by Robert Williams, I expected the writing to be of professional quality, and it was. The story flowed smoothly from scene to scene, and the characters' dialog was realistic. The story grabbed me from the beginning, and the action is pretty much nonstop, ending in an extremely tense and violent climax. Blended smoothly into the action is the relationship between Kelly and Spencer and the blossoming romance that brings them closer together.Editing was generally good, but there were a number of typos in my Kindle version.

I was actually pretty surprised at how much I liked the plot of Maiden Flight. A lot of the story was world building, character introduction, and crazy hot m/f/m sexytimes. This is my first m&eacute;nage a trios read so it&#8217;s exciting to get something new under the reading belt. Being a short kindle freebie I was pretty satisfied overall. I&#8217;ve read some reviews that mention how similar this is to Anne McCaffrey&#8217;s Dragonriders of Pern series and I can&#8217;t comment on that because I haven&#8217;t had the chance to start her books yet. I can do some similarities between authors and the worlds they create but I really don&#8217;t like copycats, just saying. I hope I don&#8217;t find out in the future that it was a little too alike for my tastes&#8230;The storyline concept was actually really interesting if not a little over-the-top. The dragons are intelligent, fierce, and very loyal warriors. They are matched with a human knight that they can telepathically communicate with. But the bond doesn&#8217;t stop there &#8211; the dragons are unable to mate until their knight counterparts find their mate first. Why, might you ask? Well knight and dragon have such a unique bond that they can actually feel what the other feels. So in other words the dragon sex drive is so strong that it would drive their knight insane if they had no mate to run to. This exceptional fact made all the sex scenes pretty fascinating. If there was human sex, there was sure to be dragon sex involved as well, and vice versa. This I could handle. The insta-love on the other hand I had an issue with.I mentioned in a previous review that I used to absolutely adore the idea of love at first sight. It&#8217;s such a dreamy and romantic idea that I still sometimes like to daydream about it. But reality and reading well-paced romantically involved books has shifted my judgment. I find myself actually cringing and rolling my eyes pretty far in the back of my head when insta-love hits a heroine and/or hero. Sadly in Maiden Flight&#8217;s case the couple (and the third-wheel!) gets hit pretty hard. Now of course once I got my eyes to focus in their proper position I just accepted the fact that it was part of the story. After that I could enjoy most of what was going on.  I actually enjoyed the romantic situation between the heroine&#8217;s mother and her perspective beau. It was slower-paced and much more realistic.Although there wasn&#8217;t much of a plot to be found I still enjoyed the book. I liked Maiden Flight so much that I went ahead and bought the next couple of books to see how the story progresses. I am hoping the sex scenes become a little bit more creative and the characters get more fleshed out. I&#8217;m hoping for more of the plot to come to the forefront about the war going on, the politics within the Lair, and I&#8217;d like to see more interaction between the characters. I like me some sex but I also like some dialogue, some intrigue, something, anything really. Hopefully I&#8217;ll get some of that with the upcoming books.","02 21, 2014",AR6U5BOVA5PYY,Mishel (P.S.

The most indepth mysteries if have read are Stephanie Plum lol so I cannot base my opinion very well on the mystery genre. So I will just base it upon my experience with smut. :)******************SPOILERS***********************Yes there were holes in the story that didn't add up. He owns a security company but didnt set the cameras up properly? Quitting the military to look after disabled brother? Sending Gramma off to condo living and not knowing that the house that had been in the family for years had a secret passage? Max still thinking the vandals were kids? I could go on and on about how the author thinks the readers are not bright and wouldn't pick up on all the plot holes. So instead of writing what I didn't like, I can write what I did like??I liked how Max and Ryan met. That made me smile. I felt their attraction to each other when Ryan came to her house to inspect for security. I thought the author did a great job making the reader ""feel"" their attraction instead of just writing ""Max likes Ryan"". When they were both so incredibly drawn to each other but needed to maintain a professional reserve was amusing to read.I liked that Ryan and Max didn't just sleep together the first time and it took a bit for them to do so.I really like how well the author orchestrated the smut scenes. (okay epic thesaurus fail on turgid penis)I thought they were hot and well paced. Well paced in the sense that, after the first time, BAM! they were not hopelessly in love. (I really hate when authors do that)I thought it was interesting to add the storyline about her ex Jamie being a lousy lover and how he made Max shower first or no oral or intimate touching etc. If her previous boyfriend was her only experience and that's what he made her do or what they did, then that's all she knows. I loved how the author wrote regarding Ryan getting her out of that frame of mind. It was like it's own little story within the story.I also enjoyed the ending. I felt Max had really grown since the beginning of the book and I liked her change. I was super happy that the book did not end with having a baby or something. God I hate how books end with babies.So yes, major plot holes and unlikely situations but I still liked it. Question is would I buy the next Turner book? My answer is no.

There is little a writer can do to change the angle on this one. There is also the difficulty of religion. Exorcisms in the western world are based in the Catholic faith. It takes a skilled writer to create a nuanced, complex story without falling into the for or against religious argument. Graham either lacks the skill or wanted to take sides here.William Peter Blatty's hand is all over this story. Bibles, Jesuit priests, and epileptic fits abound. Graham's story vanished numerous times to images of Linda Blair and pea soup. There is also a very religious subtext to the story. The protagonist moves from a borderline non-believer to a believer. ""She knew everything would work out. She had faith."" Throughout the story, there are repeated references to sin and guilt. I read these as implications that Cheryl (our possessed girl) was inhabited by demons because she had been corrupted by sin. A very medieval concept, particularly considering the stance the Church took toward women in the 1200s (the womb as a vessel for Satan and all that nonsense).I am still not sure if this is just a ripoff of The Exorcist or one of those religious tracts disguised as a horror story.

10423,3426,B001V9KG4E,"[40, 50]",2,"This book really confused me. I was able to put most of my questions aside and enjoy the book for what it was- a Swiss Family Robinson story about teenagers.OK, now for my many quibbles:1) This book would be YA but there's lots of sexual innuendo and implied sex scenes.  Ok, so I guess I'm an old fogey and am forgetting that the young'uns are maturing way faster than before.  But this is what I really don't like about the book- the fact the ""adults"" in the story (defined pretty much as everybody over the age of 20) start pairing off with...the teenagers. Yup. The chief of teens instigates a rule that you cant have sex before age 16, and maybe a couple that is 16 and 20 or 21 is ok.  But what we have are, err, a mature mother of two (I think she's close to 30) and a 16 year old (she does joke about robbing the cradle but then follows up confessing she has erotic dreams about him).  Then there's a construction worker/handyman who has to be in his mid-20's at least, who gets in bed (but no sex! yeah right!) with a...14 year old girl.  I'm sure you will love the scenes where he fantasizes about her perky, err, bottom clothed in skinny jeans, and the day she wears a teeny tiny skirt.  Very uncomfortable reading this, to say the least.2) So, teens will be teens. Referring to my comment #1, the sex between the teens, though slightly unsavory, is realistic in the end.  Now, oddly enough, the premise for bringing them all together is the fact they were all attending an abstinence camp.  Whizz goes the irony! sorry, though, there were no religious connotations at all in the book. Nor did these seem like your bunch of bad behaving kids sent to labour camp. Is there really, really such a thing as an abstinence camp that is not related to the church? Did the author just choose this setting for the irony?3) Again, teens will be teens. I'm alright with some of them being more mature and taking charge, even if the Chief is a 15 year old. But what about the emotions? It really seemed the kids took one paragraph to get over the shock of being stuck atop the mountain...then boom, they are back to playing and chatting. No thoughts of mom or dad? Siblings? Friends back home? It's like these kids shrug at the fact life as they know it has changed drastically. Kids are resilient but to have none of them freak out and break down emotionally at the thought of being alone with no family is just really bizarre.4) The gender issue. Hey, I'm a girl and I once was a teenager. I will admit at one point, all I cared about was getting a phone in my room. I was extremely shallow with my clothing, makeup, friends. So no surprise at some of the girls' behavior in this book.  However, for ALL of them to be such sheep? The two girls who join the ""inner circle"" (the group in charge) admit that most of their acceptance by the guys  is because they're the ""girlfriends."" and then the Chief blurts that fact out loud. Reaction?  Nada. I think a few girls toss their hair and/or stomp off to pout. But that's really about it. Geez would it kill to have the girls actually gang up and retaliate a bit?5) The ""science""...or lack thereof. There's a weird fog surrounding the mountain. there's creepy stuff in it that kills. According to the prologue the fog is alien in nature or something like that. Ooooh. But then that's the only mention of the fog in that context. Dang it, would it kill to have one or more of the teens try to investigate the fog? Or the ""army specialists"" do some research into the fog?  Everyone just seems to lie back and accept it all. Not one thought on how to escape. Ugh!Well there's more but I feel I've ranted enough.

The characters were always sighing for this or sighing for that; it was in every chapter as well as giggling at the wrong moments and methinks were used way too much. Also as that reason sounded a little bit redundant so did some of the story when the characters would explain something they sometimes do it twice but worded it slightly different as if the authors forgot they already had it in the story causing the story to drag. Also the actions of the characters didn't make since to me either.....spoil alert.... the parents of the heroine jump to conclusions and don't believe her when she had been forced upon by her cousins intended calling her a whore.  Also she is seen unchaperoned by multiple people with the hero when they were hiding their relationship where I might add there was no romance development... anyways she was seen and even recognized by the king himself but never becomes ruined even when her father finds out. Instead he beats her in the street for all to see and apologizes later in the story like he isn't a bad guy and she accepts his apology!!!!

There's things to like here; the concept is amusing (for the short form, girl gets murdered by boyfriend, hires a P.I. to help find her body, wacky hijinks ensue), the writing style and voice are clear and entertaining, and the technical aspects of the work are well done.Why only two stars, then? Primarily because it feels disjointed, and a trifle incomplete. Scenes just sort of happen, with little rhyme or reason. There's one point that the dead woman is &#34;teasing&#34; the PI in the shower, seemingly with no better explanation than &#34;because reasons!&#34; There's several sequences featuring an almost painfully flaming gay man that, while perhaps funny, seem almost ridiculously overblown when compared to the relative down-to-earth tropes and characterization of the other players. The boyfriend-slash-murderer also manages to land himself in the unbelievable category, apparently having a secret gay side, huge amounts of debts and bizarre culinary skills that are never explained and clash with the manner of presentation.Overall, I think it's the illogic of the thing that bothered me the most. To me, for something to be humorous - which Dead(ish) seems to be attempting - it has to make sense, by it's own rules and logic if by no other judgement... and Dead(ish) seems to fall short on that score. With a bit more content - filling in some of the blank spots, detailing the character motivations and backgrounds a bit more - I'd say there's enough spark here to warrant at least 3 and perhaps a 4 star rating.

It's a surprisingly uninspiring short story about an apparently very conflicted woman being forced into the company of the man she had walked out on the day before their wedding, many years earlier.This book was a freebie, but even at that price I'm ambivalent as to whether or not it was worth it.  The female lead character, Kasie, was unremarkable, and seemed to obsess on imaginary conflict where none existed.  The male lead, Chayton, was not much stronger.  I found it annoying that he demanded that Kasie cook and work around the cabin when he had kidnapped her and held her at his snowed-in cabin against her will. He seemed to think that her initial refusal to ""pull  her weight"" made her a brat, but it was actually her repeated complaints about her parents' trying to ""control her life"" that made her a whiny brat.Kasie's weak character was more and more annoying as the book went on, but when she finally meets up with her father after many years of estrangement, she acts almost as though her total lack of contact never happened.  If she was that annoyed over all those years about her father ""controlling her,"" she would not have been able to warm up to him or his new wife that quickly.  Basically, the author manufactured Kasie's feeling she was ""controlled"" by her parents to create some sort of tension in the story, a conflict to be overcome, but it's just too contrived to be believable.The ending was awkward, with Chayton suddenly acting entirely out of character compared to how he behaved in the prior 95% of the book, with no explanation for why he changed so dramatically from one scene to the next.  And what 26 year old woman is still a virgin, especially when she is supposedly about to marry a famous, handsome rock star, and who thinks she would prefer to just live with him instead?

Is it Glasgow, London, Manchester, a little fishing village in Scotland, I don&#8217;t know.So many of the stories failed to reach an ending or make any sense whatsoever. You&#8217;ve got one guy who starts the story by getting a right spanking off a few blokes, but we never find out why or what led up to it. He ends up beating a drug dealer up, tying his hands and feet together and then placing his feet through a pair of gymnast&#8217;s rings! How does he manage that when they&#8217;re tied together? And even if he untied them what would keep them there? He&#8217;d just drop to the floor.We get another fellow who&#8217;s the butt of a joke at a roof party &#8211; I&#8217;m trying desperately not to be a &#8216;spoiler&#8217; here &#8211; with the words, &#8220;Should have known who&#8217;d been holding the it an&#8217; all&#8230;&#8221; and I&#8217;ve no idea what that means. Anyway he takes the opportunity to attack two of his antagonists from behind and push them off the roof stating, &#8220;I held onto their belts for a moment until I had to let go.&#8221; WHAT! He held onto their belts for a moment? Assuming they weighed approximately the same as him, he&#8217;s holding twice his own weight with no anchorage whatsoever. It would pull him straight off the roof too.This is another story that just stops. A crowded party, everyone would have either witnessed him do this or seen the bodies falling through the air and looked round at him. But no, the story just stops right there. It&#8217;s rubbish!Too often we&#8217;re left to guess at the ending. Two young boys playing on a beach hear a choir, a sure sign that there&#8217;s been loss of life at sea, and then their mother doesn&#8217;t turn up for tea. Are we supposed to assume she&#8217;s dead? She certainly wasn&#8217;t lost at sea. I didn&#8217;t know what to make of that story at all.Then there&#8217;s the story of three white lads attacking and raping Muslim women. It seemed to jump about all over the place, going back in time and introducing (I think) six Muslim men that I kind of lost track as to who was who.Nigel Bird seems a genuine chap, who&#8217;s very serious about his writing, and I feel awful offering such a poor review, especially as he&#8217;s evidently working so hard, but I have to be honest. I think his writing is actually quite good but his plots are rubbish. They have little more imagination than an average schoolboy. They start out of nowhere, in the middle of a plot, and finish abruptly when the reader knows full well there&#8217;s going to be consequences for the actions taken at the end.Every story is incomplete.

7060,8231,B002VECQ96,"[9, 9]",4,"NO SPOILERS or plot summaries. Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL: Book 1 of a paranormal erotica series with animal-shifters created by science. Fast, fun read. This is NOT a typical werewolf/werecat story. These shifters are pure animals- brawn and brute over sexy military men. This is a fun story with some very hot erotica, but you need to be ready for a ""rough ride"" to enjoy it. It really shocked me at first, but I adjusted and thoroughly enjoyed myself.SEXUAL CONTENT: Here's where you need to be prepared. Orgy, voyeurism, m/m, anal, oral, and just crazy, wild, animalistic indulgence abound here. If you can get past the sex while in animal-like state, then it is really hot, but I found that a little off putting at first. It isn't all like that, but it happens. The beastliness was completely offset by the characters, however- they were very well written to make it all work.PLOT & CHARACTERS: Plot was a little unclear at first. There's a military experiment gone wrong and it's being continued to some degree by those with no conscience... but it takes you some time to figure it all out. Luckily, the characters you are spending the time with are a TON of fun. It's a ""boy's club"" set up, which I automatically love so you have the camaraderie of a group of sexy men and then a strong, independent woman shows up who can keep up and give what she gets. Strong, sweet characters.BOTTOM LINE: This is a bit of light-hearted, heavy-lusting fun. It's a little absurd and a lot funny and very sexy. All in all a pretty good start for a series I can't wait to enjoy.RECOMMENDATIONS: (though none of these are quite as sexually... extravagant.)1. Nalini Singh'sSlave to Sensation (Psy-Changelings, Book 1)- romance series which features weres and psychics, but also carries plotlines with some substance2. Christine Feehan'sShadow Game (GhostWalkers, Book 1)- paranormal romance series that focuses on characters who have gained psychic powers through medical experimentation. Fits the ""boy's club"" set up.3. Alyssa Day'sAtlantis Rising (Warriors of Poseidon, Book 1)- humorous, but intense.

This not only applies to plot lines and characters, but also to pacing and style. She created a new, wholly different reading experience with this book compared to the last one I read.What drew me in immediately were the two main characters, Lee and Cyn (or Sin, as she is also called). They are brutal yet endearing killers out to get revenge for the wrongful death of family members. They are cold at first, hard for the reader to understand, but this soon changes. When they finally begin to work together, as a team, the way the author builds their relationship is worth the entire book. I was so amused by their interactions, taking this book from a plot-driven thriller to a deeper level.  The plot itself is fun, fast-paced (although it could have done with a bit of trimming of some fight scenes), and the reader feels in good hands as the author weaves her story together. There are many moments of tension, including sexual tension, which send the reader's heart beating just a bit faster.

Quickly the pair runs into the Templeton family at a restaurant in town.  With just one glance, Quinton knows that Regina, the wife, is the woman of his dreams.  The only problem is that Wayne Templeton owns the logging company that Quinton is working with and the fact that Wayne, with his money and respect, basically owns the town.  Quinton doesn't know how Regina feels about him so he goes about finding out.  They decide to meet for dinner the next night and they both feel an attraction for one another.  So while Regina's husband, Wayne is out of town, she and Quinton carry on a loose affair, trying not to be noticed.  Then trouble begins.  Someone has been vandalizing areas of the mill and someone is setting Quinton up for it.  While avoiding the town cops, Quinton and Regina's relationship intensifies, especially when Quinton learns that Wayne is verbally, physically, and emotionally abusive to Regina.  He only wants to take her away from such a horrible husband.The story comes to a peak when the cops come to Quinton's door with evidence that Quinton has done the vandalizing.  Quinton isn't guilty but the problem is that Regina is his alibi.  Needing to work things out in his head, he escapes to the nearby American Indian reservation that Quinton grew up on.  Quinton has been away for a long time but his aunt takes him in and gives counsel as to what he should do about his problems.  He needs to talk to Regina.The closing of the story is where I don't want to give spoilers but the reader finds out who is doing the vandalism when the last act is a huge one.  Quinton doesn't want to lose Regina, he wants to be her white night.  With the cops still thinking he is the perpetrator, he walks right up to the cops and is arresting right away.I don't normally read this kind of romance novel, but it was a freebie on Amazon so I gave it a try.  I'm glad I did.  There was some depth to the story.  Much more so than the Harelequin Romances of old.  The characters could have been more fleshed out and there were a few typos that need editing, but I did like the story.  I found myself rooting for Quinton and Regina.  It was hard to believe that they weren't caught by someone seeing them out, but they weren't.  I do have to mention that the ending was highly unbelievable and disappointing. But now that I have invested myself into this story, I want a sequel to see if the author can redeem the terrible ending to this story.

She just needs some time and space to figure out what she wants for the rest of her life, and whether or not her feelings for Ethan are real or just a by-product of their close friendship.Ethan has been waiting for the right opportunity to let Sophia know just how he feels about her.  Having been careful to give her space in which to grieve her late husband, he has bided his time in reluctant patience - he'll be damned if he misses his chance with her now.  Determined to finally make his move and tell the lovely widow just how much she means to him, he moves heaven and earth to land himself on the same cruise.  He'll pull out all the stops to make both of their dreams come true, praying that those dreams will be possible together.Home for Christmas is an absolutely wonderful tale about a mature romance between two friends who have long loved each other from afar.  With a starring couple who are both over forty, Kate Davies offers a realistic look at love the second time around for those of us who are long past the first bloom of youth, but still young enough to entertain dreams of love and forever.As a no-nonsense widow and the mother of a young adult daughter, Sophia is mindful of her family's needs, while still being very aware of her own as a woman.  When the death of her husband left her as part-owner in his business, she never hesitated to roll up her sleeves and work in the family business alongside her friend and partner, Ethan.  She knows Ethan would do anything for her, but worries that her growing romantic ideas about him are born of their close proximity and her dependence on his presence in her life.  While she is ready to admit her feelings, she needs time away to be sure of them before running the risk of damaging their friendship.Of course, Ethan wouldn't be our story's hero if he let her get away with that.  The man is romantically relentless, determined that he won't spend Christmas apart from the woman he loves more than anything.  Even still, he gives her every chance to keep him at arm's length once he arrives on board the cruise ship, while hoping deep down inside that she doesn't take those opportunities.  But Ethan means to make this relationship last for the rest of their lives, and his resolve that Sophia be sure of not just his feelings for her but hers for him are heart-warming.Home for Christmas is a wonderfully inspiring romance that will make readers rejoice in the belief that new life and new love can most certainly happen no matter your age.**This story can also be found in the print anthologyThe Perfect Gift**","03 23, 2008",A23ZNGL704AW7O,Jennifer Ray,4.5 Klovers - Courtesy of CK2S Kwips & Kritiques,1206230400

He doesn't dare tell her. He knows her too well. Whenever it comes to deep emotion, Dana keeps everyone at arms length. Playing, however, is her forte, and one night when a storm has taken out the power on the street they live on, Jake walks across to check on her, only to find her and her boyfriend in the back yard in an intimate situation. Dana comes off the porch to stand in the rain in front of him, and her entreaty is too much to resist. Ignoring his possessive nature and his dislike of her casual boyfriend Mason, he gives in to the woman he loves and joins them.Dana knows that Mason is just a good time, that Jake is forever, but she's just interested in playing, enjoying her sexuality now that she has two men who will share her. She plays with them both, unconcerned, until one encounter with Jake changes her life. When you know you're going to be a mother, you start to realize either  playtime is over...or you have to start playing for keeps. And telling Jake and Mason takes that to a whole other level.What started out as a relatively simple menage a trois erotica romance novella with Walker's classic intense romantic angst takes a turn after that and becomes a much more serious and emotionally powerful and poignant story of love and unspeakable loss. I have nothing against the first part, really, but it lacked a bit in depth and character development for my tastes. The second part was so intense, however, and the emotions so vibrant and real as Jake and Dana try to survive a tragedy that shakes them to the soul, that it utterly eclipsed the beginning and made it seem shallow.I can't say I enjoyed the second part - it was very dark for the genre - but it was very well written and felt very emotionally honest. I have to give Walker credit for the courage and strength to write something so personally devastating. I also have to admit I loved the end and appreciated the hope and joy and promise that was reintroduced.

The idea was definitely inspired, and for once a newer author allowed the characters plenty of free reign.  The characters drive the action in this story, with their backstories and personalities meaning something.Sadly, the story desperately needed someone who could have reigned in the writers.Early chapters are flooded with ""info-dumps"" where several pages suddenly start explaining the planet the heroes are visiting, or some aspect of the technology in the universe.  This left the story rather disjointed, and the early chapters do not flow very well.Later the info-dumps diminish, only to be replaced by multiple page flashbacks.  The flashbacks are solidly written, tell rather complete tales, and probably would have been much better as their own seperate stories, in building towards this tale.  Some of them were definitely necessary to help reveal the personalities, but others again disrupt the flow of the story.The biggest problem though was the characters themselves.  Maeve and Coldhand both possess damaged psyches and events from their past drive their actions throughout the story.  This could have worked very well, but both are rather unsympathetic due to the extremely unflattering ways they are described.  Maeve as a broken junkie who refuses to allow anyone to become her friend and Coldhand's quiet madness due to the injuries that left him with a cybernetic heart and hand.And of course, as the first book of a trilogy, only a couple minor plot threads come to any kind of closure or completion.  The ending was more of a place that the story ran out of steam than a clear stopping point.Overall, this is not a very good book.  The writers have lots of talent and the story is impressive in its complexity and scope, but an editor was needed to weed out all of the asides that show up as info-dumps and flashbacks, and to tighten up the revelatoins of backstories so that they smoothly fit into the story rather than overwhelming the middle part of the story.  Even the appearance of the major antagonists could be improved as the enemy appears out of nowhere about 40% into the book.The sequel will be interesting, hopefully the authors will be less inclined to throw extra information at the reader but will continue to allow their characters to grow as the story develops.","02 28, 2012",A2K0H6HYH8WB5F,Mvargus,Needed a lot of Editing,1330387200

The scenes where she supposedly sees the fun sweet side of him she falls in love with are only briefly described in a general way.

Seriously???The dialog was stiff and very simple.  It was connect-the-dots conversations.  B-O-R-I-N-G!We had an emotionally unstable/abusive hero.  Several times during the story he went from normal conversation to raging, (usually at our heroine) and back again in the space of moments all the while physically abusing our poor heroine.Our heroine was a rather simplistic person...and very flat emotionally...which was a good thing since she didn't seem to mind (or even notice) the abuse.The author couldn't keep track of her own plot.  First our hero knows all the heroine's secrets...she tells him point blank...and he doesn't care, he just loves our heroine! (ahh)  Then, he's stunned (and raging [Seeing a pattern?]) to learn those same secrets later in the book.Story/plot is jerky and doesn't flow, jumping from point to point.  I think we could see how much the author wrote in one day by the plot jumps, she seemed to loose track of where she was going halfway through a scene.I just couldn't get myself to care about any of the characters.  They are all so one dimensional and flat.  Their personalities, their conversations, their emotions (even when raging) were just so...flat.The author had no understanding about 1800's medical practices.  A *Duchess* going to the doctor's office(!?) and waiting in a waiting room(!?!) and then our hero in a rage (you MUST see the pattern by now!) and barging into the exam room(!?!?!).  [And unless the doctor is blind and deaf and the exam room is the size of a football stadium I can't believe he wouldn't notice the hero 'slamming and yelling' as he raged.]And, our villain. You could tell where the author was trying to go and the sense of dread she was trying to create...I just wish she would have followed through and delivered it...but alas, our villain was flat and unimaginative and...well stupid.  I kept expecting her to stomp her foot and hold her breath to get her own way.All in all, if this book hadn't been free I would have demanded my money back.

As a reader some things I both liked and disliked.Traver's family honor and guilt drove the story. I thought there could have been other more appealing reasons that could have been more entertaining. Rusty being forced into a situation not of his making put a bit of a dampner on the story from the beginning for me. I became frustrated for him being stuck between a rock and a hard place trying to please everyone but himself.Leaving that subject behind some of the characters bothered me as well. I felt Deke became more insensitive and controlling toward Rusty and at times I wanted to stuff a sock in it. Maybe that is what Ms. Hestand wanted me to feel and if she did than it was accomplished.I kept feeling as if the author glossed over situations that could have been built upon making the story more spicy and entertaining. Examples: had she built on Jennifer's appearance and the situation that occured. It would have made for more substance had she built more drama around the character.  I wanted to see her pay and pay dearly for her manipulation.I liked the way  previous characters made steady appearances throughout all the series so a reader could keep up with the happenings of those characters. I liked the way Cal was portrayed as the family support system even though Deke took the helm.  Emma remained a strong female Matriarch and supportive character along with Sammy Jo making her appearances.  I got to know and like this family.All in all I was looking for more meat to the story but what I read was enjoyable and more than I could have ever done.  I can come up with the ideas but could never have made any attempt at putting it down on paper as Ms. Hestand has done. Bravo.

This menage story begins with the trio already together and living their lives as a family.  Logan and Rhys are married to Catherine.  They are hard workers and devoted to their growing sucessfull business, but this is the reason that their wife Catherine is unhappy.  It seems the guys have been so single-minded in their pursuit of success that they have been neglecting poor Catherine.  On their anniversary she plans a romantic dinner at a restaurant so that she can tell them that she is pregant with their child.  They guys get caught up in a business problem and forget the dinner date.  They have to fly out to solve the problem and also cancel a planned Jamaican vacation with Catherine.  This is the last straw for Catherine and she heads to Jamaica without them.  When they discover that she isn't waiting for them at home, they realize just how much they have hurt her and fly to Jamaica to try to win her back.  This was a very romantic menage story.  The guys are hot and the reader realizes that they work hard for Catherine because the three began their lives together very humbly.  Catherine makes them realize that nothing is as important as their relationship together.  The changes they make to their workaholic lifestyles reveal the extent of their love for Catherine and results in a very touching, and sexy story.

The story was disappointing to me because it seemed incomplete due to the fact it did not answer the questions of what sort of powers they had or what the evil darkness was.

For some reason, I thought the name of this book's author was ""Chula Stone"" (that is even how it appears on my Kindle).  While this is very different in tone that the previous two books I've read by the author, I wouldn't say it is better.  In fact, in very significant ways, it is much, much worse.Lyra Seville is a young woman who just got her Master's Degree in Parapsychology (from Duke University, and I'm sure they'd be thrilled to know they were dragged into this whole mess).  Lyra is an adult and she is supposed to be of reasonable intelligence, but she still can't figure out how to get the money left to her by her parents from her aunt/adoptive mother (her aunt adopted her after her parents died).  Despite the fact that their relationship is clearly explained at the beginning of the book, Lexi will be referred to as Lyra's ""stepmother"" for most of her subsequent appearences.Lyra is a beautiful dark-haired/blonde woman (Stone can't make up her mind) who has just never found love.  Somehow she got all the way through high school, college, and graduate school without ever feeling the urge, so she's a virgin.  Her friend encourages her to go out and see a handsome magician at a local nightspot and BAM -- she falls in instant lust.Meanwhile, there is a crazy kill-rape cult kidnapping women and killing them.  Pages and pages and pages pass and it becomes clear that Nick, her handsome magician beau, may not be what he seems and Lyra is the target of the kill-rape cult.  Her virginity is of prime importance to them, leading to a bizarre scene where she is finger-violated in the woods and the doctor checking her out helpfully lets us know that she is still intact.  Plus, he adds, ""I'd bet my stethoscope"" that the kind of lube used on the assailant's glove was the same used at the hospital . . . based on the SMELL.  How exactly did that examination go again?  And why is that even an important detail (trust me, the case isn't cracked based on lube brand).Nick's old friend Detective Michael Santera gets involved and suddenly our virginal heroine has another love interest.  Also, Lyra inherits a house from a dead magician, so they move into that to hide from the bad guys.  The story goes on and on and on and on.  Lots of women get raped and killed, Lyra visits a farm, an old diary provides classically clunky exposition, there is a flashback to a murder onboard a ship that doesn't really fit at all, an evil count shows up, and Lyra has to use every brain cell in her brunette/blonde head to survive.The book is easily 100-200 pages too long for the weight of the story that it has to tell.  Lyra and her friend spent a couple of weeks hiding and the story just drags.  The story is driven by the discovery of the diary and spirit guides, truly lazy storytelling.  The main bad guy, ""the Adversary,"" is given an entire clunky backstory that barely stands up.  Once you finish the book and realize who is actually good and who is actually evil, virtually every character has done things that make zero sense.  The characters act as if their presumed motivation is their real one, but once their real allegances are known, so much of what they have done no longer makes sense.  There is an overreliance on viceral responses to provoke engagement from the reader, but there are only so many times you can read about a dead woman, never in the story, being found with stuff cut off of her, before you don't care at all.To top it all off, the editing is w-r-e-t-c-h-e-d.  The books I have previously read by Stone didn't have this issue.  It seems as if it wasn't proofed at all and there are multiple places with some sort of formatting issue that causes a single name to be repeated for a line or more.Bottom line:  this book is too long, the plot is terrible, and there is no attention to detail.

And then the story. It is a good premise, the kind of is he isn't he . Childhood memories that are missing and therefore our killer could be our author. Even he does not know. I worked it out half way through. I lost patience then with our hero's stupidity and interest along with it. I skimmed to the end although tempted to abandon ship but I was promised a twist after all. Ha, should have known better! One word can sum this up - predictable. It has been years since I read Stephen King to whom this author is compared in some of these rave reviews. From what I remember of Mr. King I see no resemblence. Stephen King is a master of suspense. His books did scare me no matter how bizarre the theme. His penmanship is vastly superior.","05 9, 2012",A741547755BZ2,"Harley ""Harley""",Ouch,1336521600

My Kindle edition of the initial issue offered included 9 short stories, including a great Lawrence Block ""Keller"" story and a new English translation of a wonderful Japanese mystery set in the world of the Japanese police. There was also a short review column on mystery blogs and a meaty, interesting book review column.  The issue was rounded out by a nice reproduction of the print edition's cover, two cute poems (crime-oriented, of course), and announcement of the magazine's 2007 Reader Awards.At the end of each story, one is given the option to jump back to the table of contents to select another story, but I chose to just sail right through and read the whole edition ""cover to cover"".  That's something I never did with the print edition for some reason.  I guess just seeing one nicely presented page at a time on the Kindle versus seeing one big intimidating digest all at once makes all the difference for us readers who battle an occasional lazy streak.I'll likely check out one or two other Dell magazines offered on the Kindle.  It was a nice diversion from the regular reading of my Kindle novel and news blogs to enjoy a piece of short fiction every day or so (I made this first issue last about two weeks).  But, whatever other Dell titles I end up trying out, Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine is likely to be the one ongoing, regular visitor to my Kindle each month.Note: Amazon frequently updates the presentation the functionality of Kindle blogs and periodicals, so as this review gets older, it may no longer accurately describe the current version of this product.","05 22, 2008",A3GRN6J64F2C3X,"Joseph P.

Plus, Samhain nor the author don't warn for the out-of-the-blue rape that occurs to one of the heroes by some off-screen criminals (which did nothing to advance the plot), and seemed pointless.

This was the case with Sukie O'Leary, her brother Sean's friend Eamon Houlihan was that teenage crush, and hew was now ranked as one of the best goalies in the National Hockey League. What she didn't know is that Eamon had noticed years ago her growing up and the feelings were mutual.They all still had connections to the old neighborhood that they grew up in, in more ways than one would think.  The boys had been successful in both athletics in high school being able to further on their education by going to Ivy League Schools. Sean was now a successful Trauma Specialist and ER Doctor.  Eamon of course with hockey.  Sukie was being talked about as well now because she had ""cancer"" and that was something everyone whispered about behind her back and looked at her differently.  Which she hated, she wanted people to just treat her like they did before.  While Eamon had wanted to rush back and help when he heard the news earlier, he waited but he did vow to treat her normally.  But he didn't know just what he was getting himself into.Practice makes you perfect is something that we have all heard, well Sukie felt she was out of practice in bed and needed someone to help her, that person was Eamon on the condition no strings attached.  Little did they realize that there were strings and the heat they created with each other was enough to melt the ice rink that Eamon played on. An accident on the ice made them realize how much they did need each other.It was a good short story and did remind us that if you do know someone who has been affected by an illness they do want to be treated normally.  I do hope that the author comes back with a story on Sean because he sounds like an interesting man himself.","01 8, 2012",A2SH5G781HK3YV,M. Bass,Will the ice help cool down this romance?,1325980800

8468,12224,B0035LDNV4,"[1, 1]",3,"I'll break this into likes and dislikes.Dislikes:1)Chronic overuse of the word ""intimated"". I kept thinking ""Gad's, there's that stinkin word again and again and again."" It was used in every chapter.When this type of adjective is needed, a good author needs to use a smattering of similar words that mean the same thing so the reader isn't seeing the same word everywhere.2)Along the same lines as number one, certain things were repeated much too often. One other review mentions the ""knitted eyebrows."" I agree. How many times can a character knit their eyebrows? I was actually tempted to count all the times this was used. Readers are smart and pick up on overuse of a word, phrase or mannerism. Change it up and keep from reusing the same thing over again and again.3)Vampires were referred to as people. They are not.4)I can forgive much of the English slang (British) but ""smeldt"" is the foulest, poorest grammar choice I have ever seen. You smelled something. Not smeldt it. It is accepted there but it's just so wrong. Every other version of British slang is perfectly fine as long as the story is not taking place in the US. Many British indie authors, use their British slang, but place their story and characters in the United States where Americans just don't speak like that. This author didn't do that, so it was fine.5)Hire an editor before releasing your books and the ratings will soar. There were many many mistakes. You can't pay for a nice front cover and other little things you purchased while putting your book together and disregard the inside work which is the most important. Your WORK is the most important thing. Edit it. I'd much prefer a plain brown wrapper on the book if it was perfectly edited.6)I get concerned about truthfulness in reviews when to me many of them appear to be staged. There is a very large grouping of five star ratings with short comments all within a small amount of time. I've seen this many times. If a book has problems like this one does, having some staged reviews to make the book appear better and more popular doesn't really work. All the real reviews will eventually come and the top reviews stick out like you got help from friends, family, fellow authors and perhaps created accounts just for this purpose. All of the five star ratings that appeared right next to each other in a two to three week period of time just isn't plausible nor believable. Maybe they're real, but they don't look like it.7)I also had a problem with the entire book getting all the way to the prophesy being fulfilled only to have it be a gigantic mistake.  Huh?  Really odd.  Its like you just read a long book and never got anywhere with it.I'm done picking it apart....Likes:Each character, separately, were created rather well and the author was creative. There were many different characters introduced here and it's not easy making them different and interesting. It was a bit daunting to have all these different vampire clans, but at least this book didn't sound like everyone else's.Thank you for keeping pages and pages of filler sex out of it. I much prefer an author show gradual love between two people then fill pages of sexual situations. The writer did a nice job of keeping the tension going and slowly building the relationship. I'm guessing this was in the YA cat.Thank you once again for making Prophecy a strong independant woman. My favorite part about the book was when she tore into Valentine when she thought he was telling her what to do and that he did not own her. Bravo. I'm not a fan of swearing in books, but the use of it in this situation was perfect and if it had been me, I'd have done the exact same thing.All in all, a good cast of characters and enough interest to maybe see where this story goes in the future.

That being said...the author states at the beginning of the book that he thanks those who helped with re-writes and someone named Chene for editing. Editing? Hmmm. Need to get a new editor. Had that claim not been there, I would have given more slack. For instance, the use of 'to conger' when it should have been 'to conjure' or 'dear hunt' for 'deer hunt' and many more. As for other readers complaining about the female characters being portrayed as weak, etc...well...that is the author's right to describe his characters the way he wants. And those that had complaints about the hill people and their language-it's not an unheard of way of portraying people who have survived disasters. An episode of Star Trek (the original series) had characters butchering the language, and believe it or not, there are hill people alive today that speak in a very similar way, so no complaints there.The switching back and forth between the future and the past or rather present (however you wish to term it) is not hard to follow and actually had me curious as to how it would be resolved.If the author cleans the typos up, and fixes the incorrect tense of some verbs, and cleans up the pronouns I can easily see it as a 4-5 star book, but for now, it's two stars.

The book description above is really well-done so I am not going to add anything about the setup of the story and get right to the review part of this review.I love the way that these two characters were written so realistically. Yes, they are absolutely best friends, but when things heat up between them sexually, everything becomes REALLY awkward and tense for Mitch & Kerri. All of a sudden, they are fighting constantly and sniping at each other about everything. That's one of those things that only works with really good friends...they may be there for each other, but OMG, they know how to push each others buttons too.Kelly wrote this really well...you can see that the sexual chemistry between the two is sizzling, but they are using aggression to fight it. But when that aggression becomes too much and they do give into the sexual tension...OMG, it is so incredibly HOT. I think that I can honestly say that the sexual scenes in this book are absolutely the hottest and most erotic that I have ever read. There is so much emotion written into and woven throughout them...OMG, really amazing writing!!!The real issue with this relationship long-term is that Mitch truly does not believe in marriage. He had a horrible home-life growing up and now he's a divorce attorney. All he has ever seen is the destruction wrought by the institution of marriage. But for Kerri, she is 30 years old. She wants a family with all that it entails...a husband and kids. As these two realize that they are in love, they don't know how to get past that huge difference in ideals, without giving up their love. There is a fabulous character arc for both of them that is so sweet and truly beautiful. It's amazing writing.

And in Book 3 she is injured trying saving Sheri, the fount of all Blonde jokes, and finds her Mate while healing.- As the fourth book in the series, ""Steel Beauty"" picks up as Book 3 concludes, with Rick wanting to take Belle home.

First bookFinding Forgivenessis m/m and tells the story of Ben Malone (Marshall) and Dave Maldonado (Beta).Opinion:Another good, solid story in Bell's ""Halle Pumas"" series, linking the Pumas with her new series on the Poconos Pack. It's certainly interesting and opens a whole new avenue of shifter romances. Tossing in some telepathy and a holiday resort, it should make a good new series.As far as ""Steel Beauty"" goes, it's a nice romance. Belle proves herself to be everything a Luna should be - strong, caring, intelligent - and Rick is a lovely Dominant Alpha with a loving streak. It is an easy paranormal romance with explicit bedroom scenes and a HEA. It fits well into the series.""Little Red"":When Rick finds the costume Belle left him for the Halloween party, he's just about ready to kill her. But when he saw her, and the additional goodies, he knew this would be a very memorable party.A little story emphasising the joy in Bell's stories, especially once we have our HEA with caring, happy, respectful, loving h and H. It's sweet, erotic, and very original. Definitely worth a look.""'Twas a Coyote Christmas"":Rick tells Belle a Christmas story to ease her pain.Sometimes an author just wants to pop in on her characters and give her readers a little smile - and that's exactly what this is. There's nothing too it except maybe a little introduction to some of the characters in future Poconos books.

I only got to  51 percent, and stopped because I could not tolerate it any longer.  I have read many conqueror books from 1066,and this book was like a comedy compared to this.  Not that there was  anything funny about this book, it just seemed like a poor attempt at writing a book about this topic from the author's part.  Perhaps as p as the author was trying to write a book about Norman conqueror's that was not the usual norman conqueror children as characteristics, and if that was the case, she failed miserably because norman conqueror's usually consummate the marriage ASAP after they are wed to the vanquished bride so that they have greater claim to the land.  But this norman hero seems to suffer from some ridiculous mental flaw, that he does the contrary, only because he wants her to care for  him first.  That's fine if  this this was a typical medeival romance book, but this is a norman conqueror who was given this land and bride as conquest.  This story was totally unrealistic for this era and I was really disappointed with this read.  I suggest that the author researches her history as for this particular era, then attempts to write a book about  and,make her next book about this era as nd the norman conquest more realistic.  I would not recommend this read to anyone who is accustomed to reading adveinturous, romanticNorman conquest books.

I was getting bogged down in a history book and was looking for something quick and easy to read as a sort of mental palette-cleanser before jumping back into the second half of a rather long history book. Viola! There was Serial, a quick-read about a killer who preys on hitchhikers and a hitchhiking killer who preys on drivers and the mayhem that ensues when this unlikely pair meet. Toss in some hype about how each of the authors wrote a chapter featuring one of the serial killers, then collaborated on the final chapter in which the killers meet and it sounded like it might be a promising story. So I downloaded it. After reading the story in about 20 minutes I can definitely say this is a book that was worth every cent I paid for it.I guess I shouldn't complain because it was free ... but even so, I got the feeling that Serial was less about a unique collaboration between two action/horror/thriller authors wishing to share their experimental fiction with readers than writers finding a new way to foist rejected first drafts on readers. Other than the authors competing to see who can come up with the most gross-out scene, there's not really much to recommend the story. Don't expect any character development or insight ... just prepare for a story that could have easily been told with sound effects: Screech, thud, smash, scream followed by slurp, clang, thump, bump, scream. If you like your reading to be all action and no introspection, then by all means go for it.Oh, and as a postscript, I notice that Amazon is now selling an ""extended version"" of Serial.

6522,33476,B004BA5GPY,"[10, 12]",2,"Identical twin sisters Gwendolyn and Anora are complete opposites, but fierce friends nonetheless. Gwendolyn is the tomboy of the duo - even going so far as to cut her hair short and wear men's clothing, while Anora exudes a very feminine nature. As the eldest by minutes, Anora has been placed in an arranged marriage, but thankfully, it turned out to be a love match anyways. The night before her wedding, the two sneak out unchaperoned for one last sisterly moment of bonding, when the unthinkable happens and they are kidnapped by two wandering Vikings. They believe Gwendolyn to be male (in men's clothing and short hair) and take the duo back to their ship in repair, even though it is expressly forbidden by the captain, Hakon. From here on out, the story is about Hakon and his interaction with the 'brother' Garric and sister Anora. Gwendolyn continues her identity as Garric in hopes to keep Anora's virtue intact for her betrothed.Well, the one thing that attracted me to the story was the outline. As most of these stories go, I thought I could have predicted what happened, but unfortunately, I think my assumption was probably a better story than this. I found the story to be trite, shallow, messy, and incredibly misogynistic. I know well that most romance stories have a bit of misogyny in them, but this one was pretty thick with it.Let me start with the storytelling. It's messy in that it is constantly vacillating point of views. One paragraph is through Gwendolyn's eyes, the next is Hakon, and then the next one is some chambermaid in the same room giving her $0.02. So it goes on. It took me many chapters to get used to it. And yes, I did read the whole thing (mainly in hopes to see a redeeming quality in the couple).And the descriptions, whoa. Adverbs stacked on adjectives stacked on adverbs. I like description, but most of it felt forced or trite, as if there was a book of synonyms on the ready for *every* sentence.Also, the beginning of the story held a lot of completely unnecessary crap. If the story is not going to be about Wulfgar and Anora, maybe one should stop writing such intricate details about their history and the political notions of it all. When it doesn't last past the first few chapters, never to be touched upon again, I feel like my time is wasted with pointless words completely lacking in entertainment or reason.The twins' ruse was poorly written. I believe another reviewer noticed the same. How can the both be so incredibly fair and beautiful and gorgeous and gifts of the gods when one can be so easily mistaken for a young boy? I absolutely hated Hakon as a character, but it was laughable to read the spew of compliments he would bestow upon Anora, then hate so easily on Garric without any inkling of her identity, then praise Gwendolyn (as Anora) exactly the same - never the wiser! Yet every chapter some background character made a comment on how absolutely magnificent and awe-inspiring was the beauty of either...but only if they were in a dress. /eyeroll/ Put some pants on a girl and she's too mannish to believed to be a girl. Riiiiight.Now to the 'romance' of Gwendolyn and Hakon. Not once did I feel any genuine love between the two. For chapters, Hakon praises his affections and lust for Anora, from the very beginning. When they are first discovered on the ship, the reader anticipates a kind captain with morals, but instead the reader gets an arrogant warrior who's okay with raping and taking some hostages as slaves. While I get his reasons for not turning around and dropping the twins back off at England, did he really have to enforce slavery? Not only slavery, but insist on getting Anora to bed him as some kind of sex slave (incredibly confidently, I might add). I get that this was probably exactly the kind of man one would expect in this era, but it's not very attractive to read about in a romance novel. So not only is he constantly forcing his affections on an incredibly frightened Anora and just scaring the bejeezus out of her with his talks of forcing himself upon her, but he doesn't even get a whiff of difference when Anora and Gwendolyn change places. Absolutely nothing is amiss to him. The first night Hakon and Gwendolyn (as Anora) are together...it's just very...rape-y. He does force himself...but it's some kind of weird thing that Gwendolyn (all this time has completely hated and disgusted by this guy) just turns over like a cat in heat all of a sudden. I think, as a reader, one is supposed to just accept that her body knows what's best for her heart...or something like that? Even through the realization of love and all that, Hakon never knows who's who. I mean, I would think true love should at least be able to see a person past their indescribably beautiful body to fall in love with someone and then fall in love with an identical someone without realizing the difference. It just leaves the romance's credibility in the negative.This also applies to Gwendolyn. The reader does not come across her transition into loving him. She's wishy washy and just moody. She hates him because he took her and her sister as slaves away from her homeland! She loves him because he's great in the sack! She hates him because he's so mean to her when she's Garric. She loves him because just look at that hot, Viking body! Once she starts pretending to be Anora, all plans to escape home are just gone. Months are supposed to go by, and Anora is just sitting on her thumbs trusting her sister. I just don't get it. I don't get any precourse to love beyond lust or obligation/duty/honor above whatever it is that feels good.I mentioned the first scene of intimacy between Hakon and Gwendolyn are...rape-y. Well, the acceptance of rape was one of the biggest themes that disturbed me. It wasn't outright acceptance, per se, but it was darn close. The constant attempts to rape the twins were disheartening, but then to have the 'hero' consider it so much...yeah, not cool. One line from a background character left me doing double takes:""Whatever happened to the days when a Viking chieftain took a wench if he wanted her, and that was that! She closed her heavy-lidded eyes, a secret smile on her face, as she remembered her youth.""This particular quote in context implies that Hakon should just go ahead and rape Anora, because he's so good looking and rich and a spectacular lover, the rape will be null and void because the wench in question will love it.Yeah...this is just a horrible impression for a romance novel...and towards the 'good guy' especially.Again, I believe another reviewer also noticed the abundance of Gwendolyn's stupidity. Keep getting in trouble by walking around alone? Just keep doing it! Yeah! Not only is it a poor setup for danger, but it's also poor characterization. Need the heroine to come across the bad guy? Just write in there that she's walking around for funsies. Maybe she can not learn her lesson and do it again later...a few more times, at that.There was one line in an (albeit decent) scene of war: ""Acting on finely honed instincts..."" referring to Gwendolyn in fight. I literally laughed out loud. ""Finely honed"" indeed.A great line that's later in the book, after already been in danger numerous times:""Perhaps a walk would take her mind off the memories that continually plagued her. Aye, that was what she would do!""Such excitement for a walk!!! She must know that danger and excitement are ahead whenever she goes out alone! Good one, Gwennie!So why two stars instead of one? I read the whole thing and still hoped for a romantic redemption. I really wanted Hakon to be a decent guy. I really wanted true love to peek it's cute little head and yell, ""Surprise! I really AM here!"" If the story was just an outline, I would have enjoyed it better, because I really do like the premise. If only I had a trophy in poor execution...Lacking characters, lacking writing, overwrought descriptions, glorifying rape, zero hero/heroine presence...and thusly.Thank Odin it was free.","11 30, 2012",AWY2E5OJWN9JS,Amazon Customer,Shallow characters and shallow themes...,1354233600

Combining Native American tradition with the guts and gore of a  solid murder mystery, The Good Die Twice is certainly at the top of my best  books list.  Five years ago wealthy Robert Tyler's wife disappeared and  is presumed dead. Her body was never found. Five years after Rachel Tyler's  disappearance, Sara Morningsky, a Native American 18-year-old with the gift  of the ability to shapeshift into either a hawk or a wolf, witnesses a  mysterious woman's murder in the present. When she attends a social event  with Chase Dagger, Sara recognizes the woman on the wall as the mysterious  woman she saw brutally murdered.  Sara could not report the murder to  the police since a shapeshifter could never be convincing. When she drags  Dagger to the crime scene, they find a black, possibly topaz, earring the  size of at least fifty carats. Little do they suspect the danger the have  let themselves in for, or the dangerous story behind the earring presumed  to belong to the murder victim.  With a creative ingenuity seldom  matched, Driver presents the reader with the sexy, mysterious,  thirty-year-old Dagger and his perfect counterpoint Sara. Combine them with  the rowdy Einstein, a scarlet macaw with an incredible memory. Add Dagger's  fianc&eacute;e wanna-be, a woman with a talent for clothes and the inability to  accept that Dagger won't marry her. Complete the mix with Skizzy, the  paranoid schizophrenic with a talent for creating legal documents. The  results are a suspenseful blend that will leave readers clamoring for more.  Driver also writes as the extraordinary Sandra Tooley, the author of  When The Dead Speak and Nothing Else Matters. This author's fresh approach  to crime-fiction, with an overlay of the mystical that doesn't stifle but  enlivens is a rare blend of Native American tradition and crime-fiction  guaranteed to satisfy.Cindy Penn, Reviewer","06 6, 2000",A14OJS0VWMOSWO,Midwest Book Review,Very Highly Recommended,960249600

There were grammatical errors, misspelled words and words in the wrong order. The book at times seems to be written from the first, second and even third point of view and the Kindle version even had different fonts alternating throughout. All of this took away from the story and the mistakes got even worse the closer you got to the end of the book.The plot seemed undeveloped. The heroine:Kat saw her mother murdered and was sent, by her father, to be raised by her uncle in the hopes that he would keep her safe. Why she was safer with him was never explained. She meets a boy: Kenji and falls in love with him. Kenji goes away, but years later Kat is reintroduced to him and told she must marry him per an agreement both of their families had made when they were born. The premise is that they both have powers which are to be used to fight evil. There is a Japanese mob and other villains who want to find a way to use their powers to rule the world.(insert evil laugh here).The story reads like a Scooby Doo mystery from that point on. Kenji is a secret agent and has a team of agents backing him, the entire climax of the story was filled with the team, including Kat, her uncle and a few other family members fighting scores of assassins and ending with ***SPOILER ALERT***  Kat and Kenji using their power to kill all of the assassins at once. Which begs the question, if it was that easy, why not do that in the first place.The villains are only described by their physical appearance throughout most of the book and only at the end are they named, not that we would have known them anyway since the book does not go into detail about them at all. There was a lot of description regarding what kinds or cars everyone was driving, what kinds of watches, earrings and shoes Kenji and his crew were wearing, all of which was unnecessary. The story was based in Atlanta and the Georgia mountains, which seemed odd for a Japanese ninja fight. Also the hero was described as being a traditional Japanese Samurai but several times said slang terms which seemed out of character. To the authors credit, she did have Kat to question him on it, but it was still out of place. There were more character inconsistancies I could name but this is already rather wordy and I think you get the point.There was a very obvious secondary romance thrown in as a set up for a sequel. Lets hope the author has time to hone her craft and the second story will be more put together.","07 28, 2010",A3764BVZPCASBH,EnvyNone,Needs major work,1280275200

461,3476,B001VLXH7U,"[1, 1]",3,"Review Courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: A tear jerker story involving a threesome and struggles to find out what is most important in life: Love.Opening Sentence: ""You tramp.""The Review:If you read the synopsis of this book, it sounds a lot like a fun, steamy m&eacute;nage-love-triangle-type romance.  There is sure to be lots of sexual tension and participation, right?  WRONG!  There should be some kind of sticker put on the back of this book: WARNING - may contain highly emotional content that may not be suitable for all readers.  Oh sure, Shiloh Walker tells you AT THE END of the book, but at that point you are already read the emotionally hard parts.Playing for Keeps starts out as a story about three people: Dana, the free spirited woman looking for commitment-free fun, Mason, the current lover that provides the fun, and Jake, the love torn on-again-off-again boyfriend of the woman he loves that flees at the hint of relationship-related seriousness.  Mason is an excuse in this book, so for the most part it is all about Jake and Dana.  The book starts off with Jake sharing Dana with another man; the only way he is able to be with Dana without her freaking out.  It moves along to just Dana and Jake when they find out they are going to be surprise parents.  Then, unfortunately, moves into a terrible tragedy that threatens their fledgling relationship.  Can their love survive?Jake is like a lovesick puppy, following around the object of his desire over the course of years.  When he does get the chance to snag Dana, he grabs on with both hands.  There is not a lot of seething rage toward the man that he must share his love with.  Don't get me wrong, he hates Mason, but he wants Dana happy more and the m&eacute;nage relationship makes her so.  When he finds out that she is pregnant, he steps up to the plate and takes responsibility.  Good man.  I really liked the realism that Jake gives off.  I like seeing him respond with Dana's wishes in mind, instead of just his own.Dana, on the other hand, likes to play.  She is not the type of woman that thinks about settling down and starting a family as being her top priority.  So when news of an unexpected baby arrives, she is forced to reevaluate her life.  And when her heart is heavy with loss, she discovers what is truly important to her.  It was nice to see the growth bloom within Dana's character.  Even though the story itself is rather on the skimpy side of size, nothing about any of the character's developments seems rushed.***SPOILER ALERT***Now let's move to the part that I warned you about earlier.  The loss of an unborn child is tremendous.  You do not have to hold the baby in your arms to love it and feel the weight of their loss.  From personal experience, the sadness does not ever go away, just lessens enough for you to function.  Sad to say that in this type of tragedy, sometimes the men are overlooked in terms of grief.  Most relationships do not last after losing a child; either parent cannot deal with their grief or that of their partner's.  But there are some that grow closer in the aftermath.  Ms. Walker and I are two such cases.  I applaud her in sharing the story of her and her husband's  own experience with her readers, no matter how much it hurt personally to read and experience these events all over again.  And though I am happy with the ending of this book, I most likely will not re-read it anytime soon.***END SPOILER***Shiloh Walker is known for her dramatic prose and hard/dark themes.  Her writing will touch you, no matter your circumstances, long after the book is done.  I highly recommend any of her many stories, from her contemporary romances, to the paranormal and erotic.  But I, again, warn you that this one in particular can be an emotional roller coaster.  If you start crying, don't say that I didn't tell you ahead of time.FTC Advisory: The author provided me with a copy of Playing for Keeps.

1118,5552,B002G9UFCQ,"[0, 0]",4,"This is an interesting story about the mystery surrounding who will inherit Castlegate Manor.  There is a scheming cousin with pockets to let, a mother trying to marry-off her daughter without losing their station, a daughter trying marry her love and avoid marriage to said icky cousin, a beautiful young woman masquerading as a lady but without the proper pedigree, and a protective groom that seems more than a mere servant.  All the characters play an integral part in discovering the secret and unraveling the mysteries of the Manor.  Even a dead great-aunt influences the action as the story unfolds.I like the chemistry between the Hero and heroine.  It is a chaste relationship but the sensual tension is there; you can sense these two are drawn to each other and are fighting to keep their hands to themselves.  I also like that the h is as nice as she is smart and truly regrets any subterfuge she feels compelled to enact.  She is pragmatic and realistic but yet still has dreams of 'what could be' in her life.  The H is terribly masculine and a leader from the outset in spite of his lowly position in the stables.  The reader can guess fairly early who the groom likely is but figuring out the penultimate mystery keeps one turning pages.  The villain is truly nasty so it's easy to root for his comeuppance and there is plenty of tension and suspense as the action resolves over the last chapters.Without giving anything away, I feel some readers will say it is pure fairytale how the author deals with the disparity between the classes in her story.  History records several instances of courtesans and actresses marrying into the peerage, but the circumstances in this book make overcoming societal constraints highly unlikely.  In this story the servant is known in London and the peer is not high-ranking enough to pull off ""ignoring what anyone may say,"" especially as the resolution of the mystery would lead to much speculation in the Ton and most likely publication in the papers.  There would be no way to hide who married whom and what rank they were prior to the marriage. As a firm believer in the concept of true love and the adage that love conquers all, however, I do see these two characters marrying anyway and weathering the storm, retiring happily to the country to live their private lives.  I say disregard the fantasy of the match and just smile over the hard-won HEA.This was a sneaky little charmer of a book.  The writing style was clean and concise and the author kept the pace moving steadily throughout the book.  The secret was not terribly hard to figure out, but it was still worth reading to the end to see how the story would play out.  This was a nice, clean, light read for a Sunday afternoon.","08 6, 2013",A217BVTGFAZBLT,Chick With Brains,sweet Regency mystery and romance with a touch of fairytale,1375747200

It starts in 1865, March, Richmond, VA. The capital of the Confederacy is under siege by the Union Army under Lt. Gen. U. S. Grant.Five men, Cyrus, Pencroft, Herbert, Neb and Gideon, and a dog named Top are trapped in Richmond and wish to escape from the town. The weather is bad, but there is a balloon tethered in the middle of town, and the storm seems to provide some cover as the Confederates are less attentive with the storm. They get into the balloon with a dog and set off on an adventure. They are blown west by the storm, and end up over the ocean, with the balloon losing altitude, when they very fortunately to crash on a tropical island, which turns out to be volcanic and large enough to have a variety on the island.Interesting that Verne uses a balloon which is only coming into use, as the device to get his folks onto the deserted tropical island.The five men are a good collection of skills and personalities and work well together. Captain Cyrus is their knowledgeable and inspiring leader with an engineer's practical knowledge. Pencroft, is a practical and hardworking sailor. Gideon is kind of a ""everyman"" -- observant, strong and resourceful and loving. Herbert a young, man learning and becoming a naturalist. It is a well done book where the whole crew works hard to make a life for themselves on the island using what is available. They do an excellent job using what is at hand, and make chemicals including nitroglycerine, using what is on the island.A well done and interesting adventure tale.

Gregor is the second eldest of the Faustin brothers; from the Russian vampyr family line. He runs a series of successful clubs, made famous for the fact that they cater to New York's vampire population - a publicity cachet the clubbers love, and the vampyrs appreciate. Gregor has his pick of women, and is at the top of his game, so the last thing he needs is for fate to interrupt his life. But when you're a Faustin vampyr, you have to listen when destiny speaks . . . or suffer the consequences.Gregor is told the name of his intended bride - Madelena. But Gregor ignores the heads-up and continues on his partying ways . . . unsuspecting, until fate intervenes with a crash.`Bound by Blood' is the second book in Evie Byrne's `Faustin Brothers' trilogy. Though it is the second book, the plot timing seems a little out-of-sync with first book `Called by Blood'. In this book, Alex is a rampant bachelor and is yet to meet his wife, Helena. So really, it would make more sense that `Bound' be the first book in this trilogy, instead of the second ...I am really liking Evie Byrne's `Faustin' trilogy. I love the fact that Byrne is writing a modern vampire tale - her characters are clued-up about vampiric myths and fanged pop-culture icons, but there's also an old-world vibe. Each brother finds his bride through premonition - fated by their mother who has dreams of her future daughters-in-law. In `Called' Alex was ecstatic to finally find his bride, partly because his older brother had recently settled so well into holy matrimony. But as we back-track, it's revealed that Gregor in fact found fate to be rather inconvenient. I love that Byrne marries some old-world mysticism with modern inconvenience - a New York vampire club owner who is put-out by his destined bride. Hilarity ensues when fate intervenes, brutally.In `Called by Blood', Byrne took a very different romantic route - by severely burning her Alpha hero, and leaving him looking like raw hamburger meat. Byrne does it again in `Bound', this time posing a difficult dilemma before the heroine. I won't give it away, but I really liked the hurdle before Gregor and Madelena, if only because it completely turned the tables on the traditional vampire/mortal romance.I like Evie Byrne's paranormal romance. Once again, I wish the book had been longer, mostly because I think the really interesting part of the story would have come in the aftermath of the romance. But again, wishing a book to be longer is a fairly decent complaint.","02 27, 2011",A33C08C20U6DJ0,"Dee18 ""dee""",Fanged Fate.,1298764800

5299,13,B000FA64PK,"[0, 0]",3,"Troy Denning's novella Recovery was originally published in e-book form and is a short tale set after the events of Kathy Tyers' Balance Point. Han and Leia Solo's relationship was fractured early in the Yuuzhan Vong invasion by the death of someone in the family, and the books prior to Recovery, notably the Agents of Chaos duology, spent time exploring Han's journey to reclaim himself from his demons and Leia's efforts to be patient with the process.  Ms. Tyers reunited the couple in Balance Point as the battle for Duros commenced, but it is in this short story that they truly begin the emotional healing process.We start on Corellia with a battle in a hospital and an appearance from Han's rogue cousin Thracken Sal-Solo. It's good to touch base on what Sal-Solo has been up to since he fired the Centerpoint weapon earlier in the New Jedi Order. Mr. Denning uses this story to introduce a group of his preferred characters, a tight-knit group of saurian Barabel Jedi. Here they are accompanied by an entertainingly non-conventional, salt-addicted Arcona Jedi as well as a human Jedi, Master Eelysa, known for her lengthy and complicated solo missions. The Barabel come into full play in Mr. Denning's own Star by Star and are memorable characters: it's welcome, if certainly not essential, to have their background more fully fleshed out here.In fact, the Jedi provide the most entertaining aspect of Recovery. The Solo reactions to the explicitly non-human worldview of the Barabel are genuinely funny, especially as they struggle to comprehend Barabel humor. Mr. Denning handles the evolution of their relationship and concurrent healing capably enough, although no aspect of this jumps out at me as especially memorable. The final two chapters take the story on a race to Coruscant to stop a potentially disastrous Senate vote. This portion feels rushed, as if it was constrained by the limitations of being a short e-book, but it brings events to a satisfying close nevertheless.Certainly not an essential read, Recovery does flesh out aspects of the New Jedi Order and it worth a look to anyone reading that part of the saga, especially if you are a fan of Mr. Denning's later novels and want to get a bit more insight into the origin of a couple of his preferred Jedi characters.","03 15, 2012",A3SZMGJMV0G16C,"Andrew Pruette ""Rancors Love to Read""",Han and Leia reunited and Barabel Jedi introduced,1331769600

The author clearly has a world that she wants to develop, but unfortunately tries to do so all in the first chapter. Paragraph after paragraph of expository background.  The cast of characters is stereotyping 101. We have the tough, scary leader, his straight talking right hand man, the bookish historian and the lover that no one ever rejects (and a couple of less developed others - I guess in case the series needs expanding). Now I know what I'm reading.  When I'm looking at books like this, (as the blurb says: Mehen must protect mortals from the undead... has never struggled with the task--until he saves a woman from three undead, and finds himself in need of saving) I know I'm not passing through the frosty upper echelons of high literature. As a result, my expectations were not that high. Overall, it's not a bad story, it's just not a *good* story.  The plot is roughly handled with some chapters reading as filler between random and pointless sex scenes. The main female character is so bland she was almost irrelevant.There are also the odd turns of phrase that an editor should have caught, ""she had never seen a better looking man in person in her entire life."" That really is just clunky writing. And then there's, ""she regarded him with a small amount of fear lurking in her eyes"". An amount of something cannot lurk. Fear can lurk in her eyes sure, but an ""amount""?  The English language just doesn't work that way. This is what a decent editor should have picked up on and polished with the author.Also a little more attention to word choice is necessary, ""I'm sure just being here with you will cause Mehen to wale on (me)."" Wale is a horizontal wooden strip for a boat, according to the dictionary. The right homophone is ""wail"", spelt just like the sound. This isn't being picky - if you're going to ""publish"" then you need to do it right.Add to that the clunky plot development and inability to  handle the many characters in the story and you have a book that is a bit of a mess. I imagine with practice and an editor who is more attentive, this writer could improve.

This is a book about abuse, rape, secrets and lies. If this is not the types of books you like then I would move on.The first part of the book was not to horrible aside from the horrible grammar, overused word, misused words and misspelled words. This lasted all through the book sadly. Everyone was always biting their lips for example. Almost every time someone talked they were biting their lip. This being only one small example.My other issue is that Jenny gets in a relationship of sorts with a Pastor, she also owns a coffee shop/christen book store. Yet she uses the word God a LOT. The pastor even says Oh god several times. To me this just does not fit the characters at all. It makes the conversations and the characters seem stilted.The majority of the book was so unbelievable that instead of feeling bad for what Jenny had gone through I just wanted to laugh. No I am not cold hearted and no I am not saying all this could not ever happen to one person. How she acted and the added characters, Morgan and Chantal for example were just completely flat characters that were very unbelievable most times.The ending was tied up in a nice predictable little bow that was supposed to make you happy I guess but for me a book trying to be realistic and then everything just works out perfect does not fit.

The focus on them was mainly on them being clumsy and I would say immature.

An answer that is mutually beneficial to him and his new bride, and that will hopefully finally quell the gay rumors swirling around Hollywood's latest superstar. Kiona would never have guessed she would have to take such drastic measures as to marry a stranger but if it's between that and losing the home and the man she loves she's willing to do what ever it takes. Nothing prepared Kiona or Mitch for the instantaneous attraction that resulted in their initial meeting or the interesting secret the love of her life Kol has been keeping from her. A secret that just might help the union between three people become a triad made in heaven. That's if they can protect each other from Kiona's manipulative father before he wrecks all of their lives for good.In a story that shows what people are willing to do during desperate situations, Kabana Heat entices readers with the beauty and allure of the Hawaiian Islands and its exotic inhabitants. From the first page the stage is set when Hollywood actor meets island vixen and even as she tries to fight the heat they produce just from being near each other, Mitch is not so willing to loose a chance at experiencing how her passionate nature would translate in the bedroom. In steps the jealous and also bi-sexual lover of the heroine and this book takes off on one emotional situation after another. Feelings are dangerous enough without adding in jealousy, hurt and meddling parents who won't let go. Titania Ladley did an interesting job of setting of these three and the only thing I would have liked to see differently maybe a slower build-up between the two men.

I read the sample and immediately one-clicked the rest. I found his story setting, details, characters to all be well-written, highly detailed in the places where details counted and easily understood. Each character, from Jim, Patricia and down to little Evan were all real to me and that is a vital element for me as a reader.The action was well-founded, not cliched as some of these style books can be and never boring. I enjoyed his dialogue between the characters. Now as for some of the complaints listed in other reviews, I didn't see it. I didn't see Mr. Sides treating his female characters in anyway that degraded them or made them lesser characters and certainly while there was violence in this type of book I honestly would have wondered about it if there hadn't been. I certainly can say as a female reader that I wasn't offended and thought he handled Patricia very well.I don't normally give or say if you like a certain author then you will like so and so but in this case and for readers of the old Guardian series by Richard Austin then give this series a try.","04 5, 2010",AV707G6E5PPGP,"Sierra Rose ""Book Goddess""",Gripping and exciting action!,1270425600

I bought this sleeve for my Kindle DX when Amazon featured it as a lightning deal for under twenty bucks.

It provides good padding and grip, as all Belkin laptop sleeves do, and is ideal for carry-on travel or as protection for the Kindle DX while in a backpack or portfolio case.

They threw him out and threatened his friends if he tried to get help from anyone. Ryan lived on the streets, he headed to Canada and has just barely made ends meet trying to stay away. He discovers his twin sister, Nicole, is marrying his best friend, Peter, and even though Ryan is terrified they hate him and want nothing to do with him, he has to see his sister on her wedding day.Daniel, Peter's older brother, can't believe his eyes when he finds Ryan on a park bench the night before the wedding. He looked so hard for Ryan when he disappeared, not believing his parents who said he ran away. Daniel, Peter and Ryan were always inseparable, regardless of the five year age difference, but the last few years before Ryan left, Daniel started to feel more. Can he convince Ryan to stay and make a life with him, because Daniel isn't going to lose him again.This is a fairly short story but well worth the read.

Quinton was a great character and I loved the way that he found his way back to his Native American roots and that helped him face his present-day issues. Regina was a very complex character; she still has a little bit of self-worth left and it was struggling to emerge under Quinton's attentions. Wayne was a perfect example of how total power leads to total corruption; he is thoroughly evil. Quinton's great-aunt, Whispering Feather (I loved that name!) was marvelously wise and had a very generous spirit that reached out to encompass Regina as well as Quinton. And let's not forget Quinton's dog, Hurricane and Regina's dog, Fury; they had wonderful personalities, as well.This was a very well-written book although the proofreading could have been done better. The imagery was really wonderful; the graphic descriptions really made the people and events come alive for me. I just wish there had been an epilogue so I wouldn't have been left not knowing what happened to anyone.********spoiler alert******** I was very angry that Regina blamed herself for not fighting back sooner, especially when it was clear that the only reason she was able to prevail against Wayne's violence was because of the two dogs protecting her.

His heroes often tend to be introspective loners on the lam, and thus we get a strong psychological component. But, since Brand was paid by the word, there is also a tendancy toward wordiness; this, when combined with the aforementioned introspection, seems to prolong even the simplest actions.Brand wrote some good books; he was bound to writing so very much and in so many different genres. Indeed, many of his books (such as the Doctor Kildare series) are not westerns. But forced to churn out verbiage in magazine stories and short novels to make a living, too many of his tales seem perfunctory and more than a tad familiar, one to the next. And some plot devices are downright odd. That so many of hs books are as highly regarded as they are is certainly to his credit, but overall there is some hard-to-define quality (angst, perhaps?) about his western stories that doesn't particularly appeal to me; they somehow don't ring true. Nevertheless, for those who enjoy his stories, this set conveniently packages many of Brand's currently available public domain works.UPDATE 04-27-13: Wildside Press has just published a particularly well-formatted, 20-title ""Max Brand Megapack"" for only $.99.

It discusses the causes and contributing factors to wonky pH levels. There are lists of foods that are alkaline and acidic.

Rich girl Tess accompanies her BFF Belinda to an auction...but unbeknownst to Tess, the auction is for men or rather a date with them. Belinda already has bought a date for Tess which happens to be Jaxon. When the two meet, sparks fly and there is instant attraction! Tess fights her attraction to Jaxon and she senses that he's different from the usual men she meets. Lo and behold, magical Jaxon uses his charm and the two of them fall fast into bed. Well....there interaction is sizzling...Tess is swept off her feet and is sucked into the world of magic with Jaxon. Jaxon is called back home because there is a threat happening with their dreaded enemy, the coven of witches who want to rid their world of the wizards because they are holding the witches back from ruling the world.Ok...Tess reluctantly begins her adventure in the wizard world because she loves Jaxon and wants to be with him but she comes to find that Jaxon, although a super lover, is also very controlling and chauvinistic. He does things for the safety of Tess without consulting her and this really upsets her. Anyway, while they battle over his controlling ways, he is also up to his neck in the oncoming witches' threat with the leader being Athena. Along the way, he is also informed by the lead wizard, Falcon, that the leadership of the assembly of wizards will be passed on to Jaxon....which means more responsibility.My main problem is that there are too many rules and procedures in the world of wizardry. If the wizards are so powerful, why can't they stop the threat coming from the witches? Why, when they had several times to kill Athena, they didn't? That would have ended the threat right there and then! As for Athena, I know she is in the 3rd book of this series but seriously, I could find no redeeming qualities in her to warrant a story for her own. I don't know why Jaxon's brother is in love with her because all she comes across is a selfish, power-hungry witch...and I mean a witch literally! I did NOT like her at all in the story.

In the beginning a Zorn Warrior,  Argernon, saves Casey from men who are chasing her.  Argernon & Casey can't communicate so he just throws her over his shoulder & carries her to a cave he's been using while scouting out her planet.  She thinks he's a bigfoot and wants to take him home and keep him because he's ""hot"".  Apparently, he thinks she's hot too, because he grunts/growls at her while gesturing for her to take off her clothes while he strips & continuously points between her & his bed.  Of course, she doesn't usually do this type of thing, but he's hot so even though they've just met, all reservations are set aside.  She strips and gets in bed, still thinking he's a bigfoot.  In the midst of deciding to have sex with him, she even decides she doesn't need to worry about getting pregnant because different species, like cats & dogs, can't procreate.  Just Ewww!When Casey finds herself on Argernon's ship, communication occurs, & she finds out he isn't a bigfoot but an alien and plans to take her to his planet.  She becomes uncooperative.  In several scenes he ties her up and forces himself inside her (while she's pleading with him to leave her alone) because he can smell her excitement.  He even smilingly asks, in his all-knowing male way, if men on her planet are so weak that they listen when women say no.  ?!?!On top of all this, I thought Casey acted completely immature, getting mad at Argernon and throwing fits for stuff that was completely out of his control (but forgiving him for rape), the story was dumb, and the writing was juvenile.

Vic is able to talk to ghosts of dead people.  But Vic freaks out when he sees ghosts.  So he takes Auracel, a drug to stop the psychic ability.  It makes him sleepy and high.Vic's partner Maurice just retired and Vic's new partner is Lisa.  Someone is killing gay men.  Vic cannot find the victims' ghosts.  Another cop Jacob enters the picture.  He and Vic are attracted to each other.REVIEWER'S OPINION:I liked the investigation, the nature of the bad guy, and how it was resolved.  There's some mystery, a little suspense, and some hot romance between two guys.  Jacob is the gorgeous dominant who intensely wants Vic and comes after him.  It's told in first person from Vic's point of view.  It's typical first person with the feeling of all these things happening to Vic.  There's a touch of wimpyness to Vic, but it wasn't a problem.  (However he became too wimpy for me in the sequel  ""Criss Cross."")  The sex scenes between Jacob and Vic are hot.  Jacob goes after Vic and makes all the moves.  Vic is surprised that Jacob wants him.  The ending was cute.  It was a novella.  I prefer longer books, but this was complete and longer might not be better.  Although I would have liked more relationship development among the characters.Conflicts were well supported.  The author didn't stretch to contrive, which I liked.DATA:Narrative mode: first person Vic.  Kindle count story length: 1491 (285 KB).  Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words.

This was definitely what I was looking for. ""Bonded by Need tells the sexy, erotic story of a trio of characters who simply can't keep their hands off each other. At least the men can't seem to keep their hands off Jayda. Jayda is a polymorphic shifter, which means she can transform from a human to a wolf or a cougar. She's recently moved to a new town and is now meant to marry the head of the wolf council.Jayda and the wolf council leader Cole are bonded together and destined to be married. The wolf part of Jayda is happy for the connection and Jayda hopes that all of her can be satisfied by the relationship with Cole. But her cougar side is crying out for someone else. That someone else just happens to be the head of the cougar council, Zane. Both men are obsessed with Jayda and can't seem to stay away but can either one actually satisfy her completely?Cole wants to be life mates with Jayda and believes that he is the only one for her. But Zane can't resist the seduction Jayda employs to try and get him for herself. Jayda wants both of the men but can she really have them both? Everything is starting to change as more and more people are killed and Jayda will need to make a choice before someone else ruins everything for good. But can she really choose between the two different sides of herself? And can she choose between the two men who both promise to satisfy her so well?This book is a great story about how one woman can be torn in more than one direction. I think Jayda is a character that nearly any woman could relate to since she seems like she's in a struggle between herself to choose which mate will be the best for her. This is a lot like just about any woman who is trying to make a choice that could prove to be incredibly important to her as time goes on. The two male characters are each hot and amazing in their own right and you'll be rooting for each of them by turns as they show their true colors and their true feelings for Jayda.This book is a great story about romance and love as well as involving some supernatural elements in the form of the shape shifters and the things they have to face in order to make their way through life. If they don't make some decisions quickly, decisions will be made for them and the results may not be good at all.","11 28, 2012",A33I6PERQJQ2TR,Sam,Amazing Combination of Love and Supernatural,1354060800

She's not looking for a lifelong love or even a long term relationship but she'd love to find a master who can bring out the full extent of her passion.Even after all this time Jane is still hurt by Peter's betrayal and knows trusting anyone with her heart or body will not be easy.  Her best friend and business partner Lily accompanies her to a bondage-themed event that their business R.S.V.P. is responsible for setting up.  It's more than just networking for Jane though, it's her first foray back into the BDSM scene and she just hopes to find one man who appeals to her.Once they arrive at the party location, Lily and Jean Jacques settle into their non-interested attitudes despite the fact that the sexual tension between them is practically off the charts.  Jane's just waiting for Jean Jacques to toss Lily over his shoulder and show her just what she's missing.  Jane spends the evening hunting for a potential master for the night but no one's sparked an interest.  What she doesn't realize is that Antonio Villareal spotted her the moment she entered the ballroom and he has every intention of getting to know her - in every way possible.Antonio isn't having the best of luck when it comes to women.  Sure, he's rich, gorgeous and single but women are only after him because of what they'd gain by being seen on his arm.  He's looking for a submissive woman to share his life and has set his sights on Jane.  The only problem is she's told him upfront she isn't looking for a happily-ever-after.  Some really hot sex in the here and now will do wonders for her but anything further is more than she's willing to consider.  Will Antonio be able to convince her that she can have all the smoldering sex she could ever want if she'd just give him a chance?Dominique Adair's storylines are ones that I'm consistently drawn to over and over.  Her plots and characters never fail to draw the reader into the storyline while promising to seduce you with each heat filled scene.  In SEDUCING JANE PORTER we're introduced to Jane, a character who's love and trust was horribly abused yet she's brave enough to attempt another foray into the BDSM world.  Antonio is exactly the sort of master Jane desires - even if she isn't aware of it yet.

And for my first, I thought that I would dive right in with the horror/thriller story, Serial, by Blake Crouch and Jack Kilborn (aka JA Konrath).Goodreads description:Remember the twin golden rules of hitchhiking?#1: Don't go hitchhiking, because the driver who picks you up could be certifiably crazy.#2: Don't pick up hitchhikers, because the traveler you pick up could be raving nutcase.So what if, on some dark, isolated road, Crazy #1 offered a ride to Crazy #2...This story was a short, quick read, written in a very unique way. According to the info at the back of the book, Kilborn and Crouch each built their killer, and their killer's pre-story before sharing what they had with one another. Then, they collaborated and finished it up together. Sounds sweet, huh?It's anything but sweet. As far as stories about kindred souls finding each other go, this one was dark as all hell. Even in such a short format, Crouch and Kilborn are able to stick you into the warped minds of their characters, and make you never want to be on the side of the road again. It's gory and perverted and definitely not for people with queezy stomachs.I give it umm... (wow, hadn't thought of a rating system so I guess I'll be generic for now) 5 Stars. I was hooked from page one, Serial is well written and the characters grabbed my attention. I would recommend Serial for anyone that wants a quick and bloody read.I wish it was longer, but to be fair, there is a longer story out there, Serial Uncut, that I haven't picked up yet.

Since her father's death, she has been on her own fighting off her neighbor Ed Franks attempts to buy her spread.  Ed had even managed to have her credit cut off in town, and had intimidated everyone so completely; they refused to sell her any goods at all.  When two gorgeous cowboys showed up looking for work, she was skeptical of their motives right away.  It would not be the first time that Ed had arranged for spies to infiltrate her employment for nefarious purposes.  Dakota normally relied on her gut instinct when it came to her judgment of others, and she honestly didn't believe Joe Taylor and Colt Mason were out to harm her.Joe and Colt were very intrigued with the little spitfire that held them at gunpoint.  They had heard a little about her dire circumstances, and couldn't believe she was still able to stand her ground.  While they were there for personal reasons, helping this woman that got to them, had immediately become paramount.  All three had an immediate connection, and both men intended to explore it wherever it took them.I have enjoyed the Dakota Heat series.  In this offering we are introduced to Dakota, who has had to develop immeasurable strength just to survive.  She has had the weight of the world on her shoulders for so long, she has forgotten what it is like not to live in fear.  She is afraid to believe in the strength and pleasure these men bring into her life.  Dakota is a delightful character written with a hard backbone, but yet she is very vulnerable below the surface.  She is well matched with equally strong men Joe and Colt.  These two men haven't lived an easy life, and even though they have every reason to have hardened hearts, with Dakota, they are whole and loving.

She hadn't missed the almost physical relationship they had, but the friend that she trusted and confided in.Billy had reached a crossroads in his life.  He was at the top of his game in his professional life, but nothing else in his life satisfied him.  When he was asked to consult on a project in his hometown, he jumped at it.  Eden had never been far from his thoughts, and now he was going home to claim the woman made for him.  He didn't expect this to be an easy journey for him because his treatment of her so many years ago had been nothing short of abysmal.  His behavior was only one barrier keeping them apart, and the other was that his decision on the community center would have such a huge impact on Eden's life.  Billy could very well be stripping her job out from under her if his recommendation is to condemn the current building housing the center.  With all the issues circling them, Eden tried to resist the pull she felt toward Billy, but it was inevitable that they succumb to the intense heat between them.Eden is a strong character that has not had an easy life, but the loss of Billy was one loss she never recovered from.  Billy realized his error in judgment early on, and was back to claim the woman that had held his heart since high school.  While Eden scrambled to keep her armor in place, Billy did everything he could think of to penetrate it.

A leading lady that is strong but not hard and sarcastic is a welcome change for me. At first I thought Abby very smart - then she makes a choice I did not feel was in character for her and her strength sort of fizzles.I felt that the concept of a guide was good - that a new werewolf needed someone to help him/her control the wolf and learn about the community. Surprisingly that part did not seem rushed to me - I was fine with it. I thought the sex scenes were fine - they don't overwhelm the story nor do they seem contrived just for their own sake.What this book needed is about another 50-100 pages. Its true you hit the ground running but it leaves you with a quizzical bewildered viewpoint that just never really goes away. Too many unanswered questions.It needed backstory as to why the bad guy would turn Abigail, what he stood to gain from it, and why he so desperately seems to want her back. And her own backstory is flimsy - you just don't really feel her at all.Although there is some explanation of the politics of the shifter world it needed to be more in depth - as we are told repeatedly that there are bad alpha's and good alpha's and the good are becoming more and more scarce. I was very intruiged with that storyline and wanted a lot more depth and explanation of it - especially as the Main alpha Gavin didn't seem to have a ton of contact with other ""old school"" alpha's. It seems as if the story is going to devolve into an us vs. them...if so we need to be more connected to the ""us"" so we want to win against the ""them"".The werewolf/witch war also needed a bit of backstory - again another intriguing concept that gets barely a scarce mention and a very brief exposition. It would have been a much stronger book if we would have experienced Keith in combat - as it is we are just told.And that was my main problem with the novel - we are just told too much. It definitely had the feel of a series set up - the elements are all here they just don't fit into the puzzle as nicely as they could have. It has a very superficial feel. Like you are scratching the surface only and there is much below. It needed more fleshing out.However it is a quick read (very quick - all told less than an hour for me) and the characters are likable enough. It has great potential to develop into a wonderful series with more depth. I will be picking the other books up to read on my Kindle.","06 20, 2010",A3TP31S61PPE3G,AlexJouJou,A pretty solid 1st in the series with a few issues,1276992000

Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL: Book 1 of an erotic, paranormal romance series that boasts a wide variety of fae creatures from Sidhe to vampires to leprechauns and dragons. Stories are fun and light, while also full of magic and heavily lusty sex. There is some lighter bondage and toy play. This is a short book, quick read, not quite completely satisfying, but definitely an intriguing start to a series that could be a TON of fun. (I've read book 2 and it's even better!)PLOT: Nice pacing with plenty of tension, but abruptly resolved. The plot managed to encompass not only the central couple, but also their family and introduced us to the greater politics of the magical world. I notice other reviewers thought there was too much plot for this to be erotica- I can't agree. I can't enjoy something that doesn't offer stakes greater than the central romance. This book offers both nicely. It was resolved too fast, though. It also suffered BIG TIME from First Book Syndrome where it spends too many of its short pages setting future books.CHARACTERS & ROMANCE: Leo and Ruby were both good characters and it was a sweet romance. Ruby was definitely the stronger of the two- it was nice to have a girl who was a more natural shape. I loved her smart mouth. Leo wasn't really developed enough, but still sexy. Their attraction was a little too fast, but still satisfying. The scene using the toys was a bit surprising though- not as well done as I've seen in other books. It kinda came out of left field, so I can see why other reviewers weren't thrilled with it. That kind of thing can be highly erotic when done properly, but it was a bit clumsy here. Aside from that, though, this was a strong romance- I really wanted these two to stay together. The plot worked nicely around them.BOTTOM LINE: Strong opening to a series. It gives a little bit of everything- sweet romance, funny characters, rich magical world, lusty sex, and plenty of action. It might have been better as a longer story, but overall I really enjoyed it.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. R.G. Alexander's steamy vampire/were/witch romance series:Regina in the Sun (Children of the Goddess)2. Vivian Arend'sTidal Wave: Forces of Nature, Book 1- a light, lusty read with frolicking dolphins3. Anya Bast'sWitch Fire (Elemental Witches, Book 1)- sweet, sexy para-romance with witches, demons and more4. Kresley Cole's adventurous  and intricate magical romance series (never mind the ridiculous title):A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)5. Jacquelyn Frank'sJacob (The Nightwalkers, Book 1)- demons, were, vamps and other fae finding their better halves in races that should be the enemy6. Larissa Ione'sPleasure Unbound (Demonica, Book 1)- demon centric romance series that sets up a demon-run hospital under a human city. Not as well written as the others.7. Sherrilyn Kenyon'sFantasy Lover- Dark Hunter series with shifters, vamps and Greek gods. The first book is not as good as the rest- it just gets better and better.8. Renee Michaels' sexually adventurous, but basic werewolf romanceHer Chosen Wolf: The Were Chronicles, Book 19. J.R. Ward'sDark Lover (Black Dagger Brotherhood, Book 1)- darker, more violent and incredibly intense vampire romance series. Vampires protect the world from evil. Vivid glimpses into the evil perspective as well.10. Lara Adrian'sKiss of Midnight (The Midnight Breed, Book 1)- also darker, more violent, but incredibly intense.

I gave it three stars because there was very little background information given on the two main characters, and it didn't seem as if the author stuck to her own story-line the best.  We're supposed to believe Cullen has been crushing on Sarah for six months, and can barely speak to her, yet after he rescues her he seems to speak to her just fine, then has difficulty speaking to her again, then doesn't.  Not to mention he has a picture of her he had taken and kept in his wallet for months, but it never mentions how (or why) he took a picture of her without her noticing.  I also didn't care for the way Sarah didn't really stand up for herself until the end of the book, despite years of poor treatment from half the town.The sex scenes were good, but the author didn't seem to spend much time putting detail in to anything else in the story.  Sarah challenges the clan leader's wife to a fight that is supposed to be to the death, or if the loser surrenders, she and her family must leave the town forever.  The fight is not described at all; it goes from Sarah issuing the challenge to Sarah and Cullen relaxing together later in the evening.  What?!Not a BAD story, but just not what I was hoping for.  It's pretty short, so if you're looking for a quick, easy read, it might be what you're looking for.","03 7, 2010",A1F69CSFV1GHPP,J. Westfall,"Good story, but too short!",1267920000

Once I put that portion out of my mind, I could appreciate the erotic scenes.Ross inherited certain alien genes from an experiment between human and Laetez scientists performed on his father.  While the experiment enhanced his father, they caused hyper aggression and strength in Ross, which led him to a violent life of crime.  Thyme is a counselor at Bane prison which houses only prisoners like Ross, maladjusted offspring of the original experiment subjects.  Luckily with counseling and some drug therapy Ross has learned to control his behavior and is now being released.  As part of his release he has taken a job as a manager of a space station, where he will live alone for 3 years.  Meanwhile Thyme who had developed feelings for Ross, decided to try and meet Ross in the real world.  Since he has never seen her face or even heard her real voice during the counseling sessions she has to be inventive as to how they can meet on a one man station.  Then starts the passion.As stated in the beginning I have an issue with a doctor/patient relationship, especially one that has lasted for more than 4 years.  However, when I ignored that issue, I found the story to be well written.  The story line was plausible (in a sci fi setting) and the sex scenes produced that lovely little zing.  Even though this is mainly a piece of erotica it also contained an interesting universe and several non sex related scenes which were written quite well and helped develop the relationship between Ross and Thyme.If you like erotica, I can recommend this story.

I found the characters to be very irritating especially Kir and Logan and Jordan's siblings. However I did like Jordan, she was the saving grace of this story.

As you can imagine the sex was lustfully hot and full of passion.  The plot flowed at an exciting, swift pace so be prepared to quickly dive in and not to come up for air until the conclusion makes it dramatic appearance.  Readers, you will not be disappointed with this one.  Enjoy!NikitaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","04 8, 2010",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,Overboard,1270684800

All the 'Wedding From Hell' drama you'd expect plus it's still full of characters you love to love or love to hate.  Plus there are nice plot twists to keep you guessing, a few anxious moments that don't last too long and overall, a fun read.I'll give Benjamin props for creating more than once, a female villain that I just loved to hate (as in the first book).  Granted, while I wanted her flattened by a meteor or slapped silly in an ""Airplane"" like line-up by most of the characters, but her comuppence was adequate.Five stars, highly recommended with more of the same fun, quirky characters, cute pets, over the top small town Texas that makes these books a pure joy to read.","04 14, 2011",A2UPOT4H1GNL3I,"E.

I am really just sick of reading about women who cow down to a man because he knows how to get them off.

So the books I would put this in line with are, Captive in the Dark, Seduced in the Dark, The Tied Man, Undeniable for the shock factor, Underestimated for the captivity and treatment, Wanderlust for the dominance of the main character - these are to name but a few.So a brief take on the characters, oh my squirming behind, those masters!  Hateful, hurtful and totally magnetic, same goes for Tane, the Mountain Lord, this guy is one of the darkest male leads I have ever come across but I couldn't help but be mesmerised by him.  Yes the inner part of me wants him to suddenly realise what a complete A-hole he is but again he's penned in such a way that you're drawn to him in a weird way, it's almost like being compelled.Callie aka Mischief, I love that girl, my heart bled for her and my stamina routed for her.  I wanted her rebel like she was, I wanted her to be able to show them she could take everything they threw at her and remain true to herself but of course they just upped their game, total dominance is required and I felt each time a little chink of her was stolen from her.I also loved that although this is one of the darkest books I've ever read it also had its lightness, for instance (she had to remain facing the wall):-*** The door opened and I quickly snapped around to face the wall again. From behind me, a low voice drawled, ""Was that movement I just saw?""With a hint of amusement, one of the guards replied, ""To be fair, she did glance at the wall once or twice.""""That's what I thought."" ***So if you can handle truly dark erotica, not a single flower in sight, only the devil in many forms that you will like this book and if like me you appreciate the building of the book and its deliverance then you'll love it like me.  I can't wait to read Mercy and see what that has in store.","09 3, 2013",A14Z3HHQ6JGJA2,An avid reader.,Darkness and Depravity......... truly not for the faint hearted,1378166400

This book was mostly all sex, like other reviewers have said.  I did not like either one of the characters at all.  I did not feel the connection and love Cole & Tessa had that was suppose to be there from the beginning, it just lacked in so many ways.The sex was good, lots of BDSM but I thought a little poorly written.  I read a lot of this type of book so didn't see anything wrong with Cole tying Tess to the bed naked while she slept and ""forcing"" the sex to start when she awoke.  I have read a lot of Lora Leigh to know the sex in her books are out of the box and need people with a really open mind to read (I loved her Men of August series but got it lot of negative reviews).  The thing that I found the most wrong was Cole never had Tess pick a safe word.  When you have sexual situation where Cole is pushing and testing Tess's limits, like he explains to her, its pretty important to have a safe word, especially since he didn't listen to her saying NO, which is why you have a safe word.There was little storyline, not much keeping me to read to the ending, just lots of sex and the menage at the end.

I figured that it would continue with them living together and the struggles that they faced with being a threesome couple. The author raised that issue when they went to the parade. The characters discussed the issue briefly but nothing more came of it as the book suddenly ended. I thought for sure that the author would continue with the story showing how they struggled with their threesome relationship with their families and with the public.

The author could have done so much with that. The struggle in her decision to choose which one to legally marry and the one who wasn't chosen struggling to accept her choice.

Interesting questions are raised:  Can a thinking zombie still care about humanity?  Could zombie and human work together to overcome the common evil?  What qualifies as humanity?  There are some grammatical mistakes in the series, particularly in the first book, but for me those faded in significance as I was caught up in the unique ""smart zombies"" premise, the multidimensional characters (it was particularly interesting to see the world through the eyes of the smart zombies), and the action as Max and friends try to stay alive.In book one, Outbreak, Max meets his first zombie at the office, and fights his way home to his family.","07 20, 2011",A3DN2PISIG14C6,C.

Book 1 of the series. It's a quick read, a simple story, easily forgotten, but you'll enjoy it while you've got it- like cotton candy. Also like cotton candy there will be moments when you want to roll your eyes at how incredibly sweet (or corny) it is. There is no hard, brutal edge to this story.PLOT: There really isn't one and for a day at the beach, that's ok. You're looking for para-romance, then this will cover it. Not really erotica- the sex is simple and straightforward, but HOT all the same.CHARACTERS: Stereotypical- dominant male, sassy, but smaller female protected by big brothers. No development.BOTTOM LINE: This isn't a great book, but it will get you there. If you are looking for something reassuring where the nice guys win, there's hot sex involved and the characters can turn into big angry lions with huge teeth, then this is for you. But don't look for anything other than that.RECOMMENDATIONS: (these are all pretty basic shifter-centric para-romance)1. R.G.

The  books in series order are: 1) The Lost Fleet: Dauntless, 2) The Lost Fleet: Fearless, 3) The Lost Fleet: Courageous, 4) The Lost Fleet: Valiant, 5) The Lost Fleet: Restless, and 6) The Lost Fleet: Victorious.The Alliance has been in a state of war for 100 years with another group of human worlds called the Syndicated Worlds, or Syndics for short.  John Geary was thought to have been killed in the early opening attacks of that war.  In reality, he escaped certain doom in a survival pod launched from his Heavy Cruiser.  He was placed in a state of hibernation, with the expectation that he would be picked up in a few weeks, but something went wrong.  The emergency beacon on his pod failed, and he drifted until he was accidentally found 100 years later by another Alliance Battle Cruiser.He was revived and found himself thrust into command of the entire Alliance Fleet (which was lost deep behind enemy lines) and expected to miraculously get the Fleet home safely and to put and end to the war once and for all, and he was to do this against the overwhelming forces of the Syndicate Worlds.Compounding his problems is the fact that he must deal with a group of rebellious officers among his own crew, a love relationship that can not be acknowledged, politicians at home who want to arrest him when he gets there for a crime he has not committed and for which there is no evidence to suggest that he ever thought of committing it.  And if that were not enough, he also has to deal with an unknown enemy with unknown technological capabilities that is known to exist just beyond the border that marks the extreme edge of Syndic space.If you like SciFi that's filled with space battles based on reasonably thought out tactical plans and strategies, this series may be for you.  It is much closer to reality than the Lensman series, though I will not say that is a better or worse story line.  That is for the reader to decide.","09 7, 2010",AWYOWZKRBKQHQ,Mary Ellison,Relentless,1283817600

If you're able to get past things like that without losing your connection with the story, you'll really enjoy the series.

8109,5365,B002FK3U00,"[0, 0]",4,"Second in the Wild West Boys romance spinoff series from the Rough Riders with this story based in Broward, Nebraska. The couple focus is on Blake West and Willow Gregory.My TakeThis is strictly romance for those of you expecting the erotica from a James story. And it&#8217;s sweet, cute, and very, I dunno, metrosexual?? Is that a word I can use for a guy who is sensitive, sweet, concerned with his health without being obsessive, trying to find himself---and very considerate of the woman he&#8217;s with...oh, yeah.He also takes on the negative characteristics attributed to women: he&#8217;s pissed that he might just be a one-night-stand. Even though that&#8217;s all he had been looking for.It&#8217;s rare to find a romance in which the guy is the softer, gentler half, and this one is it. Blake is amazing in his understanding, in being such a gentleman (when a woman needs him to be), and such a lover when she needs that.I loved the twist James put on this right from the start with a naughty Willow waking up in a strange guy&#8217;s bed. Combine it with Blake&#8217;s reaction, and I&#8217;m all over readin&#8217; it. James also stretched Blake&#8217;s reasons for being in Nebraska out nicely. All those hints and reflections had me wondering what he&#8217;d done wrong.There were a few places where Blake took umbrage, and I didn&#8217;t understand why. Seemed out of character for him. The fact that Dreyfuss was the only person to talk about how attracted all the men in town are to Willow was annoying. Why weren&#8217;t there at least other indications for the readers to be aware of that an obtuse Willow could have not seen?Okay, for all my moaning and whining, I liked the honest communication between Willow and Blake. I did not appreciate Dave&#8217;s entry into the scene. That was clumsy and seemed more mean than anything.LOL, I did like Mandy&#8217;s ploy! And I liked that Willow caught on, to the learning part, and then eventually the truth. Then there was the scene between Blake and Willow&#8217;s dad...ROFLMAO funny.Yeah, who knew? Who knew that a McKay cousin could be so comfortable and attuned to a woman&#8217;s needs out of bed, LOL.&#34;I call you sunshine because you light up my world.&#34;The StoryToo caught up in proving herself, Willow Gregory finally realizes there&#8217;s more to life than work...thanks to so-called friends standing her up.It&#8217;s that humiliation that sets this story crackin&#8217; as Willow lashes out, and the sheriff lashes back. It&#8217;s a week of payback with the ultimate in payoff when Willow meets Blake West, an all-around nice guy who seems to have picked up some ideas from those rowdy, rough McKay cousins.The CharactersWillow Gregory is so not a girl&#8217;s girl and heads up a construction team for Gregory Construction and constantly feels the need to prove herself. Jackson is her younger brother who&#8217;s away at college. Big Kenny is her dad...and they ain&#8217;t kiddin&#8217;...he&#8217;s BIG. Cerise was her best friend, but she&#8217;s married to a soldier and living in Germany.Blake West is at loose ends, trying to find himself, and when his friend, Dave LeRoy, asks for help with his bar, LeRoy&#8217;s Tavern, Blake jumps. Darren West is his dad, and he&#8217;s in rehab for a stroke.Mandy is a hardworking waitress at the bar with a four-year-old daughter, Anya, and a fifteen-year-old sister, Roxy, to take care of; Ginny is not. A hardworking waitress that is.Norbert Fossum is a dirty old man who finally got his comeuppance. Sheriff Mayhew has an unusual approach to mayhem. Destiny is the not-friend who put Willow&#8217;s name up for the pageant. Paul Shulman is a Gregory electrician and the company&#8217;s biggest gossip. Don Dreyfuss owns the International Harvester dealership in town, and knows Willow&#8217;s daddy. Gloria is Dave&#8217;s significant other, if the break-up isn&#8217;t permanent.Catching up...This takes place about a year after Nick and Holly marry and they're expecting a child (see Mistress Christmas , 1).Chronologically, it fits in the Rough Riders series about two weeks after Indy has baby Hudson.The CoverThe cover is cute with its subtle patriotic colors in Willow's sexy, white short shorts along with the blue drill and the red bra top. I do love the tool belt that almost obliterates those shorts! All up against a backdrop of red and white fireworks bursting from a deep blue background.The title is an inciting incident in this story, for it&#8217;s the end of Miss Firecracker&#8217;s reign, and she&#8217;s lettin&#8217; loose!","12 27, 2013",A4SKIA2A7IDRX,"Kathy Davie ""kddidit""",Some great twists to this sweet romance,1388102400

He's even more astonished when the man's scent reveals that he's Vadim's mate.  As soon as he gets rid of the men searching for their omega, he sets about claiming his mate.Sashenka, otherwise known as Sasha, has spent years being tormented and mistreated by his pack Alpha.  When he stumbles upon Vadim, he's more than ready to be claimed and protected from the cruel Valeriya.  After years of bad treatment, however, he's afraid to trust.  And Alpha Valeriya doesn't seem to want to let him go...My Lupine Lover is a fast-paced werewolf tale.  Protective Vadim makes an excellent match for Sasha, who's alternately fearful, playful, and tough.  There are a lot of secondary characters, mostly other pack members, friends, and the eminently hate-able villains.  The revelations of Sasha's past are interesting.  My problem with My Lupine Lover is that everything happens with lightning speed.  Vadim claims Sasha within a few minutes of meeting him.  Sascha seems to get over his mistreatment a lot more quickly than I found believable.  Vadim was a bit too perfect.  My Lupine Lover was a fun read, and I enjoyed it, but I couldn't help feeling that the book could have been great, had there been a bit more emotional conflict to go along with the external ones.

Numerous specific crimes are mentioned, along with very specific punishments. Most of the crimes revolve around things dealing with farming, buying and selling things, and debts.Punishments ranged from paying a fine (in money or goods/animals), to somewhat much more severe, like having a hand cut off, all the way to death. Some of the things I found most interesting are as follows:Threaten a witness? You die.Judge makes a mistake in giving the penality? Out of a job.Steal. Depends who you steal from. If you're rich, you pay 30 times the amount stolen; if poor, you pay ten times the amount stolen. The laws seemed to be fairly balanced in this way, the penalty in money or goods higher for the rich person than for a poor person.If a woman opens a wine house? She dies.If a wife has sex with some other guy and is caught, they are tied together and drowned.If a wife is very ill, the guy can take another wife but must still take care of the first one.If a son has sex with his mother and they are caught, both are burnred to death.If a son strikes a father, one of his hands is cut off.If a guy causes another guy to lose an eye or break a limb, the same will be done to him.If a guy hits a pregnant woman and she dies, thus losing the baby, then, if the guy has a daughter, she dies.There's also a whole section on the fees various people can charge, including doctors, vets, house builders and ship builders.All-in-all a very harsh system of laws, but in some ways, especially the rich paying a much stiffer penalty than the poor, most fair than today's laws.","08 2, 2013",A1NDYD4JKKY9LE,"Sarah Marie ""sarah_marie""",Harsh laws but some fair points,1375401600

It's not a lovey-dovey story where everything turns out well (as is the case with most romance books). It's a story about genuine love and sacrifice in the name of love. It's a story about a woman who finally wakes up and smells the coffee after being bogged down for so long. And this is the aspect that I love the most.

They have issued an ultimatum for her to bring her live-in boyfriend of 2 years Sean.  Only problem was that her boyfriend was an imaginary one.  Well, there was a real Sean, her boss, but Macy simply fantasized a relationship with him and used his name as her boyfriend so her family wouldn't worry about her.She is mopping around when Sean asks her what was wrong.  She confesses her problems and Sean finds it a bit humorous and flatering.  He decides to help her and accepts to play the role of the live-in boyfriend.  Spending a week with Macy should be interesting and fun.  During their time together, Sean is actually really enjoying Macy's company and getting to know her.  He is really taking his boyfriend role a little too serious.  Macy is forever grateful Sean is in it with her, but every time she sees him, her heart goes crazy and she wishes it were real.

Quentin is struck by his young partner's willingness to take chances, to reach out to other people, to women no less.  Ralph leaves everyone in his wake smiling and feeling good about themselves, from the hostess in the local barbeque joint to the battle-axe receptionist who ends up giggling at the incorrigible young man. Ralph's antics remind Quentin how long it has been since he's felt joy and pride in his life much less caused it in others.Regina is caught in the ugly and dispiriting cycle of an abusive marriage. She stands as if at a distance watching the effects it has on herself and her two children. But she feels helpless to do anything but keep the simmering violence from escalating.When these two lost and dispirited people meet something happens that changes their lives and all of those around them.  They fall in love. But if love doesn't necessarily conquer all, in this case it forces the protagonists to wrestle with deep painful questions.  When did they begin letting others make critical decisions for them? When did they stop being honorable?  Stop asking what was important to them? What they wanted to do and to feel? And when did they begin to believe that nothing they did could make a difference in their lives or in others.This is a thoughtful, challenging story. After al,l it deals with the issues that make can either break or make a person. As Quentin and Regina tentatively explore their feelings for each other they are forced to deal with issues they have caused and ones that they have let happen. They learn that love is worth fighting for. Even more important, they learn that honor, dignity and being true to who they are is the greatest gift they can give to one another and to themselves.","06 30, 2012",AO3FOFDRFYSQ6,windigo,Love is worth fighting for,1341014400

Great premise. The execution, however, left me wanting.I'm usually quick to accept the love at first sight thing when supernatural/other worldly forces are involved (angels/demons/vampires/werewolves/etc), but this wasn't a case of love at first sight, mating, or any other supernatural love-mojo. Yes, they were attracted to each other, but it wasn't love and he continued to insist (in his thoughts) that he didn't know why his fellow angels would fall for human women.They were only together for a day until they were bumping uglies (which isn't entirely unheard of - several people engage in overnight relationships) and ""in love"". That part was a little too difficult for me to accept, despite the angel & witch aspect.And the revenge that she wanted against her cheating jerk of an ex-boyfriend? Was just to make him jealous by going to a club and dancing provocatively with her angel. Felt a little too much like high school to me.I didn't feel the chemistry between the characters, and while I understand that this is a novella (which means word count restrictions), I didn't feel that the story was fleshed out enough.

As the years moved on, however, Oliver fell in love with Vincent, who shows no hint of sharing his friend's preferences for men. That is until Oliver discovers that Vincent goes to a brothel once a month, in order to avail himself of the services of a male prostitute, the same one Oliver uses.Oliver devises a very ill-informed plan, wherein he will take the place of the prostitute and have Vincent, even if it's only for one night. But the reader knows, long before Oliver does, that one night is never going to be enough and what happens when Vincent discovers the deception?Although a short novella, you don't feel cheated of storyline and characters. Oliver and Vincent are both well-drawn, rounded characters, Oliver has a bit more depth than Vincent, I would say. Vincent is quite well-to do, but Oliver's families fortunes have waned due to his father and grandfather's gambling problems and the contrast between their two lifestyles is well done. Oliver's house has gone to seed a bit, as he has no maids or valets, unlike Vincent and I had to laugh at the scene wherein Vincent tries to convince him to get a maid, but Oliver doesn't want her to wonder what the hook in the ceiling is for. Vincent says that Oliver doesn't have a hook in the bedroom ceiling. ""No, not yet.""The love scenes between our two heroes are scorching and who knew there were so many sex toys around in the Regency era? - Oliver has quite the collection! Some people might be put off by the BDSM elements, but though it is there and is quite sexy in my opinion, you also see the emotional connection between the two characters, it's not all just physical gratification. I don't think Oliver would have been that interested in it if it hadn't been with Vincent. It works for these two characters and that's what's important.You have to suspend your disbelief a little during that first scene, where Vincent doesn't know it is Oliver he is with. They'd been friends for years, surely he would have recognised his voice even if Oliver had been trying to disguise it? Anyway, I was reading it for the romance, so I can forgive that and it is an interesting way for our two heroes to get together at first. I don't think I've ever read a book with that premise before, so kudos to the author for originality. I think Ava March has cornered the market with Regency M/M erotic romances, she does it very well and you can tell from the writing she loves the era she is writing about, but her books never turn into a history lesson.A great read.","09 20, 2012",A2IZJ1BYDVNGE2,"Annette Gisby ""agisby""",Hot read :),1348099200

I was absolutely fascinated by the number of 'love it' and 'hate it' reviews, and how varied they  were, and I finally had to read it for myself to find out.  There was also the discussion about editing, and the errors that were rife through the book, with the author assuring us that an editor had been brought on board, and the book no longer has issues.In a 'light' fun read, I overlook some errors, and try not to dwell on them.  Life's too short to nit pick.  But I'm afraid more editing is still needed in this book.  I believe the author is serious about her craft, and wants to write more books, so I'm sure she will want to make sure her product is as good as it can be.  That will keep people coming back for more.As a story, there wasn't enough depth for the length of the book.  The story was fine, but long, detailed discussions of each meeting or encounter took up too much of the book.  I can accept someone getting that head over heels feeling at first sight, but looks are not enough to carry a long term relationship, or being ""in love"", and there was very little development of the characters beyond the ""mile wide back and rippling muscles"" and hair that smells like coconut.  And some details shifted somewhat in the book - Avery was 5'9, then 5'10, then 5'9 again.  I didn't pay a lot of attention to her physical appearance, but felt the author did not have a firm grip on how the characters looked either.  I like to imagine the characters for myself, but get thrown when the details don't add up, or don't remain consistent. Many times, I had an impression the heroine was a tiny, petite girl, (with an a cup bra size) but then a height of 5' 9"" (or 10"") and size 9.5 shoes isn't petite at all. And how many shades of brown can one head of hair be?There were spots where it looks like an attempt at editing was made, and corrected text was inserted, but not all of the old text was removed.  I do think the author has potential.  Otherwise, I wouldn't have attempted to pinpoint the things about this book that kept it from earning a higher rating from me. Another round of editing could easily bring the grade up another point or two.  The author does have a talent for descriptive scenes, and the reader will feel they are part of them.  But technical errors distract, and jar me back to reality, spoiling the effect of the scene she had spun.

But she has to go alone...or else. Her friend Val has been gone a month with no clues to her whereabouts. As the first lead, she's determined not to screw it up. So she goes, and meets one of the sexiest men alive.Sin-Bad Stoner is an old vampire who believes he's finally found the one woman who can fulfill his every need and desire. Unbeknownst to her, the brown-skinned beauty has been the subject of all his thoughts and efforts for a long time and it looks like those efforts are finally paying off.  However, she's not about to surrender quietly. So he'll just use all his vampiric wiles to lure her to his home and dominate her until she does.As a reviewer and as a reader, I've long loved everything vampire and everything BDSM:  The darker and edgier the better. When I saw this book contained both those subjects, I was intrigued. After all, what could be more compelling than an uber dominant vampire?  There were references in the story that Sin did not use any mind tricks to compel Chandra to remain with him that first night, or to like the sex they shared. But it did seem, all the same, that she was trying to fight her natural inclination to get away from him.Sin was not a very likeable character, sad to say. All throughout the story, he waxed on and on about the size of his package, but it was actually difficult to discern which was larger: that, or his unbelievably inconsiderate arrogance. On the one hand, he anonymously sent Chandra gifts before they met, so one would think his desire was to romance her. But then, after they met, he expected her to automatically capitulate blindly to his whims and desires. At one point, he even demanded she eschew all her thoughts of upholding the law as was her credo as a police officer and blindly submit to his dominance. And when she wouldn't do what he asked, he would toss her declarations of love back in her face, saying that she would do it if she loved him, reminding me of a petulant school bully, rather than a dark and intense vampire regardless of his origins.With Sin's two other sexy brothers, and a delicious premise, I really wanted to like Night of Sin but I just couldn't get past his boorishness to like the rest of the story. Because it had such promise, I find myself wanting to read other works by Marilyn Lee. I refuse to give up on this author after one read.

""Andrea steps to the edge of the platform and looks down to see her reflection in an oily pool of water."")  This is only one example of inattention to detail.  There is absolutely genius imaging (""...the basketball hits the asphalt, the sound is like a fist striking flesh"" creating a visceral image and completely clueless imaging such as ""An impossible sun...wasted sky..."".  What exactly does that mean?The protagonists are both victims and are trying to find ways to make the suffering go away--opposite sides of the same coin.  Even though the disorganization of the story--multiple characters continually switch with one another between the present and the past--reflects the mental state of both Clive and Andrea, it makes the story very hard to follow.  When Andrea finds transportation to Twilight the sounds she hears, the body she finds, and the location of the car are completely lost as the story progresses.The story is jerky making it hard to read, but the phrasing is vivid drawing you in.

I feel compelled to at least write a short review because the story has not left my head even though I finished it a few days ago. Judgment is about domination and submission with a fairly violent spanking bent. Don't get it 'twisted' though, we're not talking about sweet over-the-knee erotic spankings. The action is somewhat extreme but without permanent injury. There's a bondage emphasis as well.Judgment is a non-consensual capture story about the dominant Mountain Lord and the young woman/captive he takes a particular interest in... who he names Mischief. The Mountain Lord, Daymon Tane, is a slaver and Mischief is originally abducted with other women. The setting is then the mountain fortress where Tane and his cohorts train submissives for sale. I'm not interested in multiple captive stories unless it is personal and important between a particular couple, which is how things develop here. It is definitely a story about Tane and Mischief and, even though I know it's wrong, I like them together. The secondary characters (mostly the other dominants/masters) and the world building make the story very interesting as well and help to move the action along. And there's also the aspect of Mischief, after becoming the perfect submissive object, interacting with the outside world.Two other things to say. If you liked stories like Kitty Thomas'Comfort Food, Stephanie Snow'sDemon's Captiveor Remittance Girl'sGaijin(all of which I recommend), you will definitely like this.

6919,7571,B002SB8RN6,"[1, 2]",2,"I read the reviews and many of them praised the ""science"" and ""research"" that went intoPeak Erectile Strength Diet, but after reading this short, interesting tract I can find neither science nor research on these pages.  There is nothing here but bold, unfounded assertions based on the typical social justice meme that seeks to perpetuate the lifestyle of subsistence farming peasantry at the cost of everything modern and everything truly scientific.The recommendations that so many people praised with such blissful closed-minded endorsement are pretty simple:1. Exercise more2. Eat organic foods3. Become a vegan or as close to it as you can tolerateWhile these suggestions are indeed fitting and appropriate for the descendants of French, Indian, Chinese, and Spanish peasants, the rest of us cannot survive on such meager fare.  If these ideas were so very helpful to the peasants, then why did they work so hard to abandon their ancient ""healthy"" lifestyles in favor of rebellion, destruction of the aristocracy, and modern living?  A vegan diet leaves a person physically weakened, emotionally impaired, and dependent on someone else for daily guidance.  In short, it creates peasants and there is a profound move through the modern world to convince you and I and everyone they can reach that we need to become peasants who do nothing but slave away in the factories and commercial farms established by the modern elitists for the benefit of the elitists.Early onset erectile dysfunction is founded in genetics. It is the result of countless generations of humanity that did not live beyond thirty years of age because their world was violent and their climate harsh.  While diet may, in some cases, have a minor impact on erectile function, it will never have the huge impact books like this one are claiming it will have.  The reason a starvation diet and hard exercise can, in some cases, bring minor improvement to reproductive function is because it stresses the physical animal beyond enduring and forces the genes to seek to reproduce in a younger, stronger specimen.The suggestions in this book will be helpful, but they will not transform an impotent or semi-impotent fifty or sixty year old into a breeding stud capable of marathon sex sessions.  Such claims are hyperbolic at best and downright deceptive at worst.  It is a pleasant lie designed to convince men to abandon their core strengths and become mild-mannered urban dwellers who won't argue with police and will consistently vote for bigger government and more government intervention into their daily life.If you truly want to know why your body is failing at forty, then you need to be readingThe Selfish Gene,Principles of Paleontology, andHard Evidence: Case Studies in Forensic Anthropology.The one thing the writer does get right is that replacing the candy bars and ice cream in your diet with dried fruit and dry roasted nuts will do wonders for your emotional life, your physical life, and your sex life.  But that's a far cry from abandoning your morning bacon and eggs in favor of powdered maca root/cocoa smoothies with a side of green tea.","08 20, 2013",A50EGYZY7RHGI,"Brian K.

SPOILER...One of the male characters attempts to rape the heroine when he thinks she is just an orphaned governess (not a &#34;lady&#34;).  A female character interrupts the attempt and scolds him but proceeds to marry him later in the book.  Why does she marry a would-be rapist?  Well, she's unattractive and a little overweight so despite her money she can't really get a man who isn't poverty stricken and is completely lacking in morals.  Poorly done.","04 29, 2014",A3Q7S33LECTDUS,Beff,Disappointing,1398729600

In between assignments they live in a remote cabin waiting for the next call, during the time they stay there they see a cougar, one theyve come to call their pet.Kaya, Hunter and Jericho create a romance that is unique, when the men leave on a call its supposed to be only for a few weeks at the most, but things go wrong and the men get hurt leaving a pregnant Kaya to defend for herself thinking she was abandoned.My Opinion: The story was touching to read and well written, surprisingly the 3way relationship wasnt an issue it was just another part to the story.","03 24, 2010",A38YS1DNHC3CVC,"Ashlyn ""ash""",Shape-Shifter romance,1269388800

And there was the way the main character was laid up for over a day by simply falling down and hitting his head. Elsewhere, the main character is described as having a ""muscled stomach"", yet he is easily injured in his encounter with the heroine's father.The mystery of what happened in the house is quite intriguing. But there is no good explanation offered for why the main character keeps falling back in time.I have to tell you, my favorite parts of this book were the more incidental scenes of small town life. When the plot moves in, it is flawed and unbelievable. I gave up over 60% of the way through the book, having had the plausibility stretched to the breaking point.This book needs to be edited for content, which is a shame because it holds such promise.

It did have quite a few typos, and misprints but for crying out loud its a self published book THATS FREE!I would love it if the author was able to make the book $3.00 and get some money for his work so that he could write a second. For a debut novel which I believe this is, it was a stellar performance. The character development was great. I could have used a little more antagonist descriptions ( its good to also get to know the bad guys we don't like), but the good guys were very knowable lovable. Sure parts were a little far fetched but its fantasy fiction?This book is chock full of heroism, good characters making common sense decisions honorably and humor.I would really like to see the story develop more, and a great way to do it would be to write it from the perspective of other survivors and give more ""alien"" information.

However, Millie's father, Harold, doesn't want her to teach in Appalachia, where Millie has dreamt of teaching since childhood, instead he would rather her become a replacement for his secretary.It's not until they visit Moose Falls, Montana for a week trip, commending  Millie's recent graduation (yet it's disguised as a business venture for her father), when Millie truly allows to LET-IT-ALL-HANG-LOOSE!She meets Johnny Pickett, at the infamous boathouse from ""Letter to a Secret Lover,"" that his father owns and he is currently employed at.

She's done a lot of growing up in the fifteen years since then and has decided that she's not going to marry at all.  Wearing breeches and working horses on her father's ranch suits her just fine.  Only her plans are thwarted when her father insists that she marry Rafe - no if's, and's, or but's.Rafe Sinclair really has no interest in getting married but a stipulation in his grandfather's will forces the issue.  He has to be married by the time he turns thirty or he loses the Circle S Ranch.  Since he's known Emma her entire life she seems like a relatively safe choice but the last thing he anticipates is the little hellcat's insistence that he agree to stay out of her bed.  To make matters worse, little Emma is looking mighty gown up and he's just discovered that he wants her - in every way.Since Emma insists on her no sex clause, Rafe counters her with a clause of his own - that she reserves the right to change her mind and void her clause at any time.  Though still not entirely comfortable with the situation Emma agrees but also requests that she be allowed to work with the horses at the Triple R. They'll both have what they want - well almost.  Things don't go exactly according to plan.  Emma's father refuses to allow her to return to work the horses after the marriage takes place, she counterattacks with the insistence that she takes some of the horses with her.Rafe and Emma marry but no sooner are the vows spoken then the trouble starts.  Emma's always been very attracted to Rafe and Rafe is definitely finding it difficult to adhere to her `no marital privileges' clause.  What's a guy to do when he discovers that is new wife is the sexiest thing on two legs?  Well being a man of his word, he can't just grab her up and take her to his bed, he's going to have to seduce her.  Only Emma's just as stubborn as he is persuasive.  Which one will hold out the longest?Beth Williamson presents readers with yet another wonderful historical tale with her contribution to the LEATHER AND LACE series - BRANDED.  Emma won me over from the very first page.  She's so `in-your-face' and not afraid to go against convention that I couldn't wait to read all about her and find out how or even if Rafe can `tame' her.  Rafe grew up knowing Emma so of course he's never seen her in any sort of sexual way but he's seeing her now and practically salivating just thinking about bedding his own wife.  Ms. Williamson even throws in several supporting characters that you'll love to hate or hate to love, but in either case they're definitely unique and fun.Be sure to keep an eye out for the other LEATHER AND LACE series books.

She's a little concerned about how the evening will turn out since she's aware that her ex, Peter, will be present.  There's a sense of pleasure in the knowledge that she hasn't let Peter's betrayal destroy her.Antonio and Santos have thoroughly enjoyed the time they've spent with Jane.  They've shared women before but Jane's the first one who's really brought out the possessive and protective instincts in both of them.  The men are stunned to learn about Jane's previous relationship with Peter and how long she'd been deceived.After learning about Jane's ex's disrespectful proposition and abusive behavior Antonio and Santos vow that they will pay Peter back for hurting their woman.  Jane simply wants to get on with her life now and forget that the relationship with Peter ever happened.  Besides why worry about the ex-jerk when she has the evening's activities to look forward to - and Antonio and Santos definitely know exactly how to get her juices flowing.While Jane's dealing with her men and preparing for the masquerade ball, her best friend Lily has a bit of drama of her own unfolding.  She and Jean Jacques have reached a stalemate in their relationship and he's openly flirting with a bevy of blonde bimbos.  She's insanely jealous but letting it show would be intolerable.  Fortunately Lily has a special friend who is more than willing to help her elicit a reaction from Jean Jacques - and even if he doesn't react well, Jane will have at least scratched an itch.REINVENTING JANE PORTER is the third book in Dominique Adair's JANE PORTER SERIES. I've thoroughly enjoyed getting to know each of the characters in this series and loved the sexual freedom that is such a prevalent theme throughout each individual story.  Jane's relationship withAntonio and Santos could easily be just three individuals indulging in their sexual desires but it's apparent that their feelings go much deeper than they'd expected.  Lily and Jean Jacques's heated encounters really got my heart pounding and definitely kept me in anticipation of each new scene.  In REINVENTING JANE PORTER we're treated to more of the characters we love as well as a couple new ones you'll love to hate and an additional suspense element that clearly displays the depths of the feelings between the characters.If you haven't read the first two stories in the JANE PORTER series I highly suggest doing so before reading this book.  The stories flow from one to the next and compromise everything from that occurs between Jane and her two men as well as Lily and Jean Jacques from the very beginning of the weekend.

663,3445,B001V9KG4E,"[3, 3]",3,"I have mixed feelings about this book. I feel that the idea of the book was a good one (what would survival after a catastrophic event look like).However I felt the characters were not appropriate for the adversity and the challenging experiences that the author wanted to explore.Let me say that I felt there was a fair amount of thought put into the steps needed to have the characters survive. This was a strong plus towards making the in the book creditable, if not for the characters ages.I liked that the book took place over two and a half year time frame, giving opportunities for us (the reader) to see how the characters lives might unfold and what other issues would come up.What I did not like about the book can be narrowed down to two things.One (and this was the biggest) was that the age of the characters was simply too young to cover the issues that the author was trying to tackle, making it all seem less believable.For example our main character 'Chief' Mike. At age 13 and a half, he takes on the role of leader for the surviving teenagers. The concerns and decisions that he comes up with are far greater then what a 13 year old would come up with. Even given that he might be more 'mature' emotionally then others his age, however there is no explanation as to 'Why' he would be more mature in his understanding of life and leadership. Without this explanation, his 'judgements' and 'rules' do not sit right with reality. I am left to say, ""That's pretty wise for an early teenager, and where is his teen emotions?""I could do this same break down with the remaining characters, but you can get the idea with this one and I shouldn't go on and on about that.The next issue that I have with the book is that often the mini-crises in the story do not flow with the over all story. They seem to be cut and pasted into the storyline. It would have been more realistic to have less events play out then to have the extra mini-crises.For example the whole lodge situation, it was announced, then left until the last part of the book to be hastily played out. I felt it was poorly played out leaving me feeling flat about its resolution.So what do I think of the story and do I recommend it?I think it is worth the read, but one should have low expectations, just as you would for a 'made for T.V.' movie as opposed to a 'made for the theater' movie. If you lower your expectations you probably will enjoy this book. Because I actually did enjoy it once I finally decided just to let the 'issues' be and imagine the characters say five years older (each).Due to some of the content (rape, murder and violence) within the book, I would recommend it to readers above the age of 16.I would like to see other works by this author, as I enjoyed the storyline, and feel that maybe in time the author will improve his craft.","04 13, 2012",A1U3LIALASYOLZ,T.

9114,2873,B001O5CHQU,"[1, 1]",4,"Plot/Storyline: 4 1/2 StarsAfter a short prologue, the book opened with a scene from a family's life near Christmas.  After a little introduction, the father jumps into a tale about Saint Nick, who was the origin of the legend of Santa Claus.Saint Nick's story was an interesting mix of fantasy and history. His life seemed to mirror much of that of Jesus Christ (so, Christians be forewarned if this sort of thing disturbs you). Obviously, plenty of research went into the writing of this novel, for which the author is to be applauded. I wasn't really able to get into the Santa Claus as a healer thing, but it did make for an interesting read. For those who were wondering, yes, there are explanations for elves and reindeer, too.One drawback was that I found it very difficult to imagine a man telling the more gruesome parts of the story to children. Initially, the children listening to the story were very young girls, preschool age, I think. The audience later switched to some prepubescent boys; however, I still felt some parts were too graphic even for that age group.The story did drag a little in the middle. I really enjoyed the intervals with the modern day family Christmas. There was a story of a father and a Christmas Tree that had me laughing out loud. Those little intervals were sparse, and more of them might have spiced up the storyline somewhat. At the very least, a little humor interspersed would have given the book a more upbeat feeling.This was not a novel that would ever become part of my Christmas Traditions. It was just way too depressing, even though, oddly, at the same time it offered a wonderful explanation for the traditions of Christmas that involve Santa Claus.Characters: 4 1/2 StarsAlthough the story was all about Saint Nick, he was not very well developed insofar as the reader was not privvy to enough of his thoughts. I wanted to know what he was really thinking when he found he was able to heal. He just seemed to take it for granted. Now, I can understand that after awhile, but the first time had to be exciting or induce some kind of emotion. I think in the mirroring of the life of Christ, the author presented the story in much the same way, as a bystander, but it would have been far more interesting, since it was fictional, to have been given more insight.Writing Style: 4 1/2 StarsThe writing style was excellent for many portions of the story. Even though I felt the novel lagged in some areas, in others, the writing in other scenes felt very rushed, to the point where I had to read sections twice to catch everything. The descriptions were vivid and picturesque. The dialogue was pretty good, but I felt a better job could have been done with the accents or vocabulary to give more a feel for the time period.","01 23, 2011",A22Z3RZ040GL35,Lynn McNamee,"4 1/2 Stars from ""Red Adept Reviews""",1295740800

There are no further books in the series available on Amazon at the time of this review.""Three Dog Night"" is definitely a sequel to ""Storm Warning"", however there is enough explanation of previous books to allow this one to standalone.Plot:Elain has recently accepted she's mated to triplet Were wolves. She's trying to come to terms with what that means. The wolves just want lots of sex.Comments:- Given this is the third part in a series, it is reasonably long (3900 kindle locations). There is plenty of sex, some action and enough plot to hang the book together.- The story of Elain and her wolves picks up almost a month after Elain was ""marked"", so about two/three weeks from the end of ""Triple Trouble"". Elain is settling into being a ""Shifter Mate"", but still they haven't bothered to explain all the ""rules"" she's supposed to know. Nor really get to know her and her past. Come on guys, if you're supposed to spend the rest of your lives together, shouldn't you at least chat every so often?- Sex is generally m/f, with m/f/m/m (for a committed m/f/m/m relationship). There is also m/m and m/m with voyeurs by secondary characters (aiming for a committed m/m relationship). It is worth noting (as has been said by a previous reviewer) the m/m relationship begins with what amounts to rape. I didn't like Elain's ""marking"" ceremony of Book 1 and thought it was ""forced sex"", but this marking ceremony is even more so. It is an aspect of these books I *hate*.  Similarly, the ""hunts"" are difficult, since they are wrapping sex in fear, excitement, apprehension, lust, but absolutely no love. She is setting the men up to force her (which they don't want to do yet allow their primal/feral parts to participate in). It is the whole point of the hunt, submission on capture. That said, it (mostly) works within the plot, the submission parts of ""Shifter"" relationships.- Also, as I have commented on the other two books, the bedroom scenes are ordinary. I don't know what the author is doing wrong but it just isn't HOT. It is frequent, it is lusty, it is in different places and positions, but it doesn't grab me. Often Elain is going into it with a ""just get it over with"" attitude; she enjoys it well enough but would rather be elsewhere. It is a shame, because one of the requisites of ""menage romance"" is they always try to make her happy and don't do it just to fulfill the male needs (otherwise she would never sleep!). There is a demonstrably loving, caring aspect of the sex which seems to be missing. So, lust not love?- More so than previous books, ""Three Dog Night"" finishes on a cliffhanger.Opinion:This is a difficult book to recommend. The plot/story is getting more interesting, with a blood pledge making itself known, unexplained murders, ""creepy"" stalkers and mystery parentage. BUT (and it's a big BUT), the sex scenes are not getting better. The forced m/m marking was world appropriate but nowhere near loving, lust not love. The setting up of the men through the hunts is horrid, lust not love. The desired submission of a (once strong) woman to their Alpha male way of dealing with the world is sad. But it isn't beyond the standard expectations of a Shifter Romance.So, do I want to read Book 4? If it was out right now, probably. To wind up the cliffhanger. Will I look for it down the track? Probably not. I will remember the harsh sex aspects of these books and forget the interesting plot arc.

I loved the world Moira Rogers's created and I couldn't help wanting more and more of it!The modern world and society are hell on werewolf traditions and the packs living in big cities have been corrupted into something more akin to a dictatorship.Red Rock is home of one of the few packs in the world where the old laws and traditions are still appreciated and is also considered sanctuary to those who need to escape the cruel life among the distorted packs.In Sanctuary's Price we get to se the love story between the werewolf Dylan and the witch Sasha. A Romeo & Juliet sort of story, since werewolves and witches have been at war for centuries and the prejudice against each other runs quite deep.I love me some Alpha males, that is no secret, but what I really loved about this story was that Dylan wasn't really an Alpha male, he is more on the fringe of the pack's dynamic and even considered a weaker wolf. It was great to see that just because he isn't an Alpha, is doesn't mean he isn't strong and able to defend those he love and care about.Sasha is terrified, all the time, ever since her mentor was killed and she has had to hide amongst the werewolves, most of which hate her for being a witch. Just like Dylan, I loved seeing her prove to be much more than what people's perception of her.Dylan and Sasha are so perfect for each other and it's impossible not to pull for them from page one. I also love that even though the romance was definitely at the forefront of the novel, there was so much more going on plot wise, that you couldn't help but getting engaged in the action and the stakes in play.Ever since I read Moira Rogers's South Arcana series I've been a fan, The Red Rock Pass series just cements my love for this great duo of authors.

It takes place much later than other books in the genre, for instance, and technology yet to be developed figures prominently in the story.For the first 50 pages or so it appeared to me that the author was an outsider, a non-Christian, who found the Christian end times prophecies intriguing and worth entertaining as an exercise in creativity, not to be confused with advocacy or belief.The emphasis on action and spy-thriller trappings bothered me a bit, but I have to give props for creativity, good characters, and a plot that supplies context for the fulfillment of the requisite end time prophecies. The dialogue includes some brief but well conceived discussions on a number of Christian themes. I also appreciate his nod to Asimov, sci-fi nerd that I am.I docked a star for the above-mentioned spy thriller violence/emphasis and for too many usage, grammatical, and other mechanical issues.","02 4, 2013",A2S2SYTO57W4J0,KrisztinaP,The End Times ala Hollywood,1359936000

It is a beauty and the beast style romance between the beastly Guardian of the Gate to the Underworld and the beautiful Goddess of Opression whose strength keeps the walls of the Hell intact and the demons (lust, death, wrath, disease...) from being unleashed on the mortal world.

Esme is desperate to leave her father who physically abuses her and is marrying her off to a much older man so she goes to her new neighbor next door who happens to be a rake - St John and insists on being his mistress but St John is trying to be a gentleman - after returning from war, he wants to make amends with his brother the Duke and his wife Miranda and so he wants to repair his reputation (plus he is poor though waiting to find out if he'll be an Earl due to an inheritance). So fearing that Esme might kill herself like she hinted at if she returns to her father, he takes her to the care of his brother and his wife and two children. They agree to help Esme by lying to her father about finding her lost and in an illness (Yea, I wasnt buying that). During the next few weeks, St John and Esme become close and her father keeps writing to her to come back home. I liked St John and Esme character but though I understand why St John kept pushing her away (but I wanted to strangle him when he talked about taking her virginity and offering nothing) and though I can admire a female who can read people and know that she is wanted despite the hero's protest, at some point you need to get some back bone. Which came too late, she finally gets what she wants and now decides to make up excuses to push him away? What!? I wanted to slap her. Then the story is like a soap-opera, now the guy she is be-throned to is even more wicked than her father. And Esme gets bad ideas in her head about St John when she was so sure he loved her even though he never said it? The book just had too many silly and stupid things going on for my taste. I skimmed alot so I cannot in good conscience give this book more than a 2 when it could not hold my interest and just got me upset.

I can't say I understand what makes a Delver a Delver except for the ability to access things quicker and move quicker, apparently they appear human except for their height. The Algors are pretty cool and I wish there were more of an explanation to them. Sometimes the explanations of things were repetitive and far too detailed  each time mentioned, but at the same time a lot of the details really brought parts of the story to life. Considering the severity of their quest I didn't expect it to be all in one book, however it was and there were times where the journey seemed rushed (time skips) which threw me off a little.

When Sydney takes a job to photo-document Ben's US tour, they meet and sparks fly.This book started out well. The characters seemed intelligent and even Ben, a late 30's veteran of the rock world, was believable as a guy who had had enough of the fast lane and was holding out for the real thing. But Sydney was a hellacious bitch to everyone. I found it hard to believe that ANYONE wanted to hire her, no matter HOW good her pictures were. She was THAT rude.I understood, from the beginning of the book, that some guy (presumably a musician) had done a number on Sydney (we aren't told what happened until later, but I guessed, easily).  But the way she was automatically in attack mode with every guy she met, was just nuts. Especially when The Incident happened like seven years before this. I am sure it was traumatic but after seven years I would assume she would have developed better coping methods, at least at work. If she had been reserved and avoided flirtations but was clever and could hold her own, she would have been FAR more likable. As it was, I couldn't fathom what Ben, who really was a nice guy, ever saw in her other than her looks (which she dressed to hide.) They had barely spoken one civil word to each other before he seemed to be totally into her. It made zero sense and was completely unrealistic.Then he proceeded to chase her for the rest of the book even though her actions and emotions gave out crazy mixed signals. He even forgave her after barely a minute's anger when she did something I thought was SO reprehensible, I have no idea why he didn't go ballistic on her. But no, he was still hanging in there beyond what anyone (normal? real?) would ever do.A lot of this back and forth (him chasing her as she puts up Huge GO AWAY signs and runs away) happens repeatedly and after a while I was forcing myself to keep reading, hoping it would get better. It didn't.In addition, the story has a number of plot inconsistencies:Why, when there were a number of violent altercations, including the death of someone famous, is there is no mention at all of consequences or paparazzi?In fact, except for controlled interviews, there are almost no paparazzi seen anywhere, ever. And when two guys have a brawl inside a room filled with journalists, nobody mentions a word of it online or in the news.Why would Ben buy a house in Maryland when he knows no one there and his family lives in Northern California? Are there NO beach houses for sale on the Pacific Coast?Why would Sydney's agent tell so many BIG lies for her? At one point I thought her agent (Carole? Can't remember as no character was all that interesting) was going to get rid of Ben with her lies and then declare her own feelings for Sydney and start a bisexual love triangle. Would have added SOME interest to the story, at least.Also, it pissed me off when Ben's ex-girlfriend saw Sydney and told Ben, &#34;I can see why you love her, she's very beautiful.&#34; Really? That's why you love someone? But it actually seemed that way, because he was so infatuated with her so quickly and for no discernible reason.In any case, I wasn't going to write a review, I just wanted to move on and forget this one. But I decided to spare others from the boredom I endured while reading this book. There is a happy ending, but by the time it rolled around, I didn't care.Save your money and buy something else.

She also works in the family business - a pub and restaurant.  Nine years later she begins doing something for herself - attending college part time.  Her current professor is Will.  When the course is over, he starts dating Keira.  He spanks her on their first date because she opened her own car door.  Each time they are together he does things that make her uncomfortable or cause pain.  The result increases her delayed sexual pleasure.REVIEWER'S OPINION:There is one scene where he stimulates her for probably over an hour while he feeds her dinner.  He tells her that if she does not come he will reward her with normal sex later, which she desperately wants.  That scene of her trying not to come was painful for me to read.  For some reason this was more bothersome to me than most other bondage/pain stories.  There are some long sex scenes.  There is rear door activity and sex toys.  Most of the scenes are he doing things to her and watching her discomfort.  That didn't work well for me.CAUTION SPOILER ABOUT THE REASON FOR A BREAKUP:Plot wise, we have a breakup, which is typical for romance stories.  I didn't care for the reason.  All of a sudden she feels that she's spending too much time with her new lover instead of being available 100% of the time for her family.  She is worried about her father's blood pressure.  She also learns that her youngest sibling Sean (18 years old) had a fight at school.  She feels she should have been around more for him.  But then the author never tells us what the fight was about.  It was sort of an empty conflict.  Mari lies to Will and says his type of sex is not for her when the truth is she feels guilty about her family needing her.  It was not a satisfying conflict or resolution - even though she does end up with Will in the end.DATA:Ebook story length: 2 hours.  Kindle count story length: 2651.

7988,12259,B0035LDNZK,"[1, 2]",3,"Two books into the Prophecy trilogy, and I can assure you, just about everything is. Awkward, I mean. No, I'm not criticizing or expressing my feelings about the book (though that's coming), I'm saying that the word ""awkward"" has popped up so frequently in both this book and the previous one that I'm getting the feeling it's a preferred adjective. Unfortunately, the problem isn't that it's used so often. For me the problem is that because it's used so often, it limits the variety of the descriptives and left me with a very repetitive and one dimensional impression of characters reactions. But now I'm getting ahead of myself...The second book in Heaton's Prophecy trilogy picks up almost directly after the upsetting cliffhanger of the previous book. Unlike some series, this trilogy does not contain stand alone books, and the exposition here is virtually non-existent. If you have not read Prophecy: Child of Light, I wouldn't recommend you try to start this one. In this book, Prophecy is shaken by the mistakes made in Child of Light, and feeling very lost and small as she struggles in Valentine's absence. Along with the surprising help of the new lord of Trenebrae, Venturi, who has sworn to protect her...despite her being responsible for the death of half his family's warriors and his lord and sire, Prophecy marches ever onward, determined to rescue her love despite the obstacles that keep popping up, and still set on being the savior, not the destroyer, of the world.I tend to agree with the other reviewers to a point. I think Prophecy: Caelestis & Aurorea is a bit better written than Prophecy: Child of Light. I can't really say, however, that I liked it more than Child of Light, because in fact, I didn't. One of the things I enjoyed so much in the first book was the slow development of Valentine's character - the changes he goes through as he turns from centuries of service and family dedication to do this rash thing by following his instincts. I found his particular journey and the developing relationship with Prophecy to be compelling.This book loses most of that, and instead offers up a potential rival for Prophecy's affections in the character Venturi. I'm not going to criticize the author's artistic license, because that's not my place. I'll simply say that the quagmire of the emotional triangle that was developed here was not to my taste. I personally found it a bit disturbing and it didn't leave me feeling much sympathy for Prophecy.I know I'm particularly hard on the female heroines in my books. Most books I read, if I can get through them just able to tolerate the female lead, I consider it a good day. I haven't been crazy about Prophecy from the beginning of the series, but I liked where I thought she was going, who I thought the character was developing into. For a good portion of the first part of this book, either while she was with Venturi or while she was making her way to save Valentine mostly on her own, I was forced to realize that without Valentine to hold my attention, I just don't like her. I think she's far too unschooled, impetuous, and immature. She's lucky that she seems to breeze through things with little to no true conflict and that she's been given all kinds of power and foresight, because she doesn't appear to have much inherent sense. And I don't understand how this young girl - who hadn't even ever left her family house or hunted just weeks ago - is so easily and with so little effort able to command such powerful magics and defeat such powerful foes when the odds and numbers are so drastically against her. It's a bit unrealistic.All in all, I thought the plot of this book meandered a bit too much, especially at the beginning, lost its focus for the first half, and had too much emphasis placed on developing some sort of odd love triangle that just flat out turned me off and made me lose a lot of respect for Prophecy. I can't say I disliked it, really, because there's much about this journey that Prophecy and Valentine are on that I like very much, but I didn't like it as much as the first book.  For me it lacked in intensity, and while the technical writing skills and grammar issues were less prevalent here, I'm still left feeling like overall, this book was just...awkward.","05 23, 2010",A2E9HDZXQORZLA,"Tracy ""One Good Book Deserves Another""",Well...This Is Awkward...,1274572800

From the clumsy dialog to the sloppy plot line to the incredibly bad writing this book was a failure.  For example, there is a point at which the protagonist is helping someone up.  The prose reads something like ""Jonathan reached out his hand and Jonathan took it.""  I am not kidding.  Now, that may be slightly paraphrased, but the essentials are there.  For example, there is a battle in an office building where the police are getting absolutely creamed.  Do they stop and regroup?  Does anybody say ""these tactics are not working?""  Nope.  They continue fighting using the old methods until practically everyone is dead.These same mistakes are made over and over and over again in this novel.  I will say that those few snippets about the Christian Faith that Mr. Somers shared were pretty spot on, even if clumsily delivered, but that's about as far as I am willing to go to provide praise for this book.  If you are bored silly, and for some reason absolutely nothing else is available and if you can get this book for free, then go ahead and read it.  Otherwise spend your money on something else.  C. S. Lewis' space trilogy is a better choice, or perhaps Kathy Tyers' Firebird trilogy if you can find it.

I found the writing and storyline average; nothing to really complain about but nothing especially interesting in the writing style. The plot line was predictable. The main characters had some depth but many of the supporting characters were homogenous. The choice of setting seemed more for the titillation factor than for the historical relevance.The focus was on the main character's sexual frustrations and strained relationship with his father. I mainly kept reading to find out how long the kid would put up with his father's abuse. Billing this as historical, though, is a disservice to readers who expect history interwoven in the story.

Fortunately for her, the United Wish Federation keeps exceptional video records, and when her UWF agent shows up to grant her wish, a disbelieving Mariah is given proof even she can't deny.That still doesn't mean she remembers her wish.It's only with her friend's help that her memory is jogged. And when it is, it's hard to believe she'd ever wish for anything else. Six years ago she'd had a magical night with a young guy named I.C. Tucker. It was the best night of her life and Tucker had fueled her hottest fantasies ever since. She would love another chance with the now famous professional poker player.When her newest client turns out to be the soon-to-be-married bride of Tucker's best friend, and Mariah comes face to face with Tucker again after six long years, Mariah realizes two things. One, the man still draws her on every level, and two...her wish has been granted. And Mariah has no intention of letting the opportunity go to waste.Problem is, their connection is so intense and her emotions so quickly involved, that having their entire relationship based on nothing but some silly wish - something with a definitive expiration date - no longer appeals. Mariah wants a happily ever after with the man of her dreams...and hottest fantasies. To get that, though, she'll have to do the one thing that may push Tucker away from her forever.~*~So this is what you get when you take a little magic and a little chocolate, add a dash of humor and a bunch of hot sex, and stir with a surprising depth of emotional connection. Wow!All Inis an erotic PNR novella that thoroughly satisfies.Lately the most consistent issue I've had with the romances I've been reading is that too many are plenty heavy on the lust but not so big on the deeper interpersonal relationships and downright light on love, with entire relationships based solely on the horizontal...or vertical....or upside down, for the kinksters out there...mambo. And I'm not talking about the erotic romances, either. So to actually read an erotic romance that manages to blend the hot sex with a solid romance between two likable characters quite obviously made for each other was a special treat that I won't soon forget.There's plenty of hot sex, sure, but I adored how Willoughby had a plausible backstory for her characters that laid the groundwork for the romance that developed, so it didn't feel unrealistically fast when the relationship start getting emotionally significant for the characters. Mariah and Tucker were wonderfully into each other for more than just physical pleasure, and that romance is as sweet as the chocolate delicacies Mariah sells. It's a great balance.The paranormal elements were fun. Davina was a hoot and she stole every scene she was in. I didn't buy how quickly Mariah wrapped her mind around the whole wish granting thing, though, even with the proof she got (which was awesome in its own right), and I found Tucker's reactions later in the book to be even more of a stretch. Those were minor grievances, however, when compared to the strength of the rest of the story and my appreciation for an erotic romance that gave as much attention to the ""romance"" as it did the ""erotic."" I liked this one a lot.Disclosure: A copy of this novella was provided to me by the author for an honest review.

9966,4570,B002B9MGD2,"[1, 1]",5,"You Can Leave Your Hat On is what the title promised, a naughty little novella on a stripper and his lover. The starting point of the story is one I already see in the past, a young and handsome College TA, Harlan, who has the hots for his even more handsome, a slightly older, College professor, Sawyer. The book respects the rules of a May / December romance plus the College setting with an Office Affairs theme... the shorten the thing, this is the classical romance by the rule, with the twist of being a gay romance. So I would say that it can appeal both to the old fan of the gay romance than to a newbie who wants to try her hand on the genre.Being Sawyer older and also Harlan's superior, he has all the trouble of the case: he can't take advantage of his position, he doesn't want to be involved with a younger man who can have everyone he wants, and plus there is also a little problem of appropriateness... Harlan to make the ends meet has a side job as a stripper in the local gay club, and Sawyer saw him at his workplace. So the point if Sawyer is gay is no more a question, but now there is the biggest problem that, even if Sawyer manages to move on the fact to have a relationship with a student, the fact that said student is a stripper is a big NO for the career of a college professor.And so Sawyer didn't make a move on Harlan, stopped to go to that club, and forced himself to have a strictly professional relationship with the boy. Only that Harlan is not of the same idea, and as soon as he reaches his graduation day, he is also ready, willing and naked for the professor to take. Harlan has all the cockiness of his young age, he is really convinced that Sawyer is avoiding him only since they have a professional relationship to preserve, and he thinks that, as soon as that problem is over, Sawyer will be all his to take. In a way I like how daring and careless Harlan is, but this only proves that he is really young.Being Harlan one of his students, it's not the only problem for Sawyer; there is also the question of his side job, as a stripper, that is not exactly a good visiting card to prove his willingness to commit and being exclusive; and then even if Harlan wants a real relationship, it's not said that Sawyer wants the same thing: he is arrived at an age where or you start to think seriously to commit, or you run at the minimum hint that there is a chance to be shackled... There is quite a controversy inside Sawyer, he is jealous of Harlan, mainly due to his job, but he is also skittish when it's time to commit and give something real to Harlan. Where Harlan is open and maybe careless, at least he has his mind clear and he knows what he wants... for all the years Sawyer has more than Harlan, he has not yet reached that level of maturity.Anyway this is a novella, mostly and erotic novella, with a lot of sex scenes, hot and nice, and all in all it spans only two days in the life of our characters, so there is not enough time to develop a lot, but I have the idea that the author has something more in mind, since she introduced some supporting characters (Harlan's brother, Rhys, and Sawyer's friend, Macon) that have too much deepness to be only a passing spectator.","05 29, 2009",A1E481YU3ZPK6S,Elisa,You Can Leave Your Hat On by Lena Matthews,1243555200

I could not believe this author is supposed to be an established writer as it read as if it was the first attempt by a hopeful teenaged writer.I was left with the impression that the author wanted to make it as ""exciting"" as possible and thus threw in event after event without wasting time on such details as good character development.  Descriptions were horrendous such as ""... she was happy with her cheerleader-like looks and athletic body"" for the description of the main character, Jessica, in the book.There were also jarring word usages that did not fit in with what little characterization we were given.  For example, a policeman who up until this point in the book has spoken in fairly standard English suddenly tells Jessica, ""You might be heroes,"" Patterson frowned, ""but I'm still angry at how you disrespected me.""As a further example of how the dialogue in this book progresses, Patterson then complains about how much paperwork he will have because of Jessica.  Jessica looks out the window and replies ""Sorry. Please don't take it personally.""  There is a lot of that snippiness in the book from the main characters who we are apparently supposed to respect for their tenacity in keeping going when everyone else is going into hysterics and making false accusations.Then there is the fact that perhaps it would have been easier to suspend disbelief and accept such things as the ""coincidence"" that leads Jessica to find out about the job in Salem and the willingness of her parents to allow her to accept a job that she was hired for over the phone without the person hiring her knowing anything about her other than she was an almost 18 year old girl who lived two states away.  Or the fact that once there, Jessica meets two girls who behave questionably and yet almost immediately considers them to be trustworthy friends and thus is willing to go into a cemetary crypt at night with them after knowing them less than one day.  Jessica is repeatedly talked out of calling the police for help when one of the new friends disappears by the other new friend who appears less than stable (to put it mildly.)Yes, Jessica, who repeatedly shows a lack of judgement and whose only growth in the story is a willingness to accept that the supernatural actually is real is the main character of the story.  I was never able to identify with her or any other character in this story.

I have decided against it.  There were just too many creep factors for me, personally, to become that involved in the characters or even to find the love scenes all that erotic (in fact, I found them very bland).  The creep factors were:1. The three men are brothers, which I hadn't expected to be that bothered by but once I started reading I didn't find it intriguing at all or believable.2.  The female protagonist systemically ""corners"" each brother and practically begs for sex from each man in turn.  Just not sexy or romantic.3.  She's 8 months pregnant at the time.4.  They all call the child ""theirs""...he is ""their son""...as in they do not know who fathered the baby and so all claim him. Something about this went against my own peace of mind.  Maybe too...cult-like?  Takes me to number 5...5.  The entire scenario is so unrealistic that even for a book I couldn't suspend my disbelief.  The author writes the 4-way relationship as a pleasant, laid back one, with no jealousy issues or the woman just throwing her hands up and saying ""I need space, quit touching me for one freaking minute"".  All is perfect in their world, nobody minds sharing and they all know each other's business.  And sure, the heroine is well cared and the men genuinely love her, but at the same time she is overly cossetted.  It left me feeling like she had no real freedom, always surrounded by men hovering over her.  She didn't have enough of an independent spirit for the heroines I usually like reading about.  Oh, and the birth scene was poorly written and also not realistic at all.Some people will like and have liked this story just fine and are not bothered by any of the things that bothered me.

Eventually, their characters sorted themselves out.The girls are self-reliant, thrown on their own devices with a new infant sister after their mother dies in childbirth. These are not the kick-butt women of adult urban fantasy, but gentler young women who rely on wisdom and cunning rather than on tough talk and gun or sword play. At one point, some of the sisters sacrifice their long hair to help nearby villagers in the non-magical reality. In other words, the Byrne sisters set good examples as females with inner strength, intelligence, resourcefulness, and compassion.In the tradition of classic fairy tales, their aunt turns out to be a black magic evil-doer. But they also have protective adults in their lives -- a close friend of their mother who becomes a mentor in magic and a mysterious gentleman from the Far East who comes bearing gifts and wisdom.As a series, this work has a lot of potential. There are, after all, the lives of seven protagonists to explore.I enjoyed this book, a free Kindle download, even though I am a senior citizen. I doubt that I will continue to read additional installments. But this is just the sort of book that delighted me as a young adult.

I don't know what it is, but the water, the steam, the whole thing just sets me off.  Here we meet Brett and Lisa, human and vampire, respectively.  And as it turns out, they are in a relationship, eleven months so far.I felt like they were really great together.  They had a playfulness, and you could still see they cared for each other beyond that flirtation.

Drink blood, or ""dirty wine"", or anything else a mere mortal might enjoy.  It's a place with alcoves and overhead walkways, loud music, and great ambiance.In the club, Lisa runs into an old friend - Leo.  Right away their familiarity puts me on edge a bit.  Um, hello, what about Brett??  So when Lisa brings both of them back to the home that Brett and Lisa share, I can definitely understand - and agree with - Brett's apprehension.But that Lisa, she's a smarty.  And there comes a point in this story when I got very angry with her, I felt betrayed for Brett, and in a very bad way.  I called Lisa some very bad names.  But like I said, she's smart.  Don't underestimate that girl, and don't think her heart is in the wrong place.And Leo?  He turned out to be one of my favorites of the five I met through these two books.

A couple of years ago I happened upon a Sci-Fi Channel offering about a guy who turned into a giant mosquito! Ha, ha! Did you see that one? Boy, it was so screamingly dumb! But it's fun to watch goofy crap like that occasionally because - well -- I'll just leave it to some psychologist to score a government grant some day and explain the why-we-like-bad-entertainment phenomenon.But I mention this because I have just finished reading the short novel, CHUPACABRA, by DALLAS TANNER. I'll come right out with a theory I have about this offering: I'm thinking that Mr. Tanner may have first attempted to write a script for a made-for-TV B movie, shopped it around, got no bites, and so decided to turn his script into a short novel.As the title suggests, this is a yarn using the legendary CHUPACABRA- the goatsucker - of mostly Latin American legend, as a premise. It's some kind of crypto-zoological beast with vampire-like tendencies that preys on farm animals. It sucks its victim dry of blood - but leaves the meat.Unfortunately, reading a bad science fiction novel does not deliver the same pleasure as watching a bad movie. I think it's because you have to work harder - you know, with the reading, and all. When you watch a terrible TV movie, you just sit back with a beer and a bag of Cheetos and let the dreck come to you. When you read a B-novel, there's all that effort with the squinting at words and turning of pages, and such.As fiction, Chupacabra makes every conceivable literary mistake a writer can make to ensure that this will be a truly terrible piece of writing - clich&eacute;-cardboard characters, blocks of exposition without action, absolutely no original concepts, and supremely poor editing.Consider: One of the characters is a lovely Caribbean-born scientist who is something of an expert on the Chupacabra. She is alternately identified as: ""an astronomer,"" ""an astrologer,"" ""an astronomist,"" and ""a technician."" I take pains to point this out to show you that I am not merely being purposefully mean and snarky in my review, but that I am only applying the unfortunate credit to where the unfortunate credit it due.You might be surprised that I am going to say now that this author is almost certainly a far, far better writer than this novella suggests. I've been making my sole living as a freelance writer and editor for almost 30 years, and one develops an instinct for those who have ""got it"" and those who never will. Dallas Tanner has what it takes to be a genuinely fine writer, believe me -- I can just tell - but no one will be able to tell from reading this book.","03 2, 2012",A1OICNXB30F29F,Ken Korczak,"Watching a B-Movie Is Fun, Reading a B-Novel Is More Like Work",1330646400

They are thrown onto an island that isn't listed on any maps and well out of the way for any ships in the Pacific to go by. They even go on a short trip to a close but un-useful island to help a castaway. For four long years these escapees have to start from nothing to make themselves a civilized dwelling. They create everything from a house in granite rock and a garden and an animal farm to any mechanism they might need to create something to survive with. They spend their days working and building and creating all the necessities as well as some wants. They build two ships and at the last second when they fear death, they are saved. There are references to 20,000 leagues under the seas and captain Nemo as well as historical things.The story is long but with all the details you learn not only to feel like you know the islanders but also enough to see their surroundings and feel their anxieties. There is adventure, camaraderie, pirates, survival, and many other things all wrapped up in this amazing classic.","03 7, 2010",AN8ELR6AHMMQ,"Jessss ""I read to find stories that inspire m...",A great tale of friendship and surviving,1267920000

At the last game, 6 months ago, the game took a risque turn which titillated Kylie's imaginations. Ever since, she has been taking dangerous risks in the form of sexual experimentation. Risks that have finally spilt over to Colt and Heath when Colt comes home early from work one evening and finds Kylie's date getting too rough in the bedroom and hurting her.  Colt and Heath decide that Kylie needs room to experiment with men that she can trust so they offer her their sexual services for a weekend of no-holds-barred sex for all three of them. Things take a decidedly hot turn from there.Wow! These 3 have been roommates for 7 years and have never crossed that line, but when they do, they go big! Colt and Heath both have Dom tendencies. They definitely take charge in the bedroom which is what Kylie is searching for in her fantasies. Above everything else, these 3 have been best friends forever and that definitely plays out in the bedroom. There is complete trust and love between all three of the and it's really incredible to read. There is a natural flow between the three of them.

When both encounters a misunderstanding, they still manage to not get along but physically wants and take each other repeatedly.THOUGHTSI thought this was a very spicy book. I am always first in line to read high school crushes who reunites later in life. Amber and Brain got together for a steamy night, but, with a misunderstanding everything goes wrong. Soon after and unable to get enough of each other with their bedroom aerobics, both characters steams up the pages with a sex only relationship. I liked that even though the relationship was purely sexual, we got to see Brain slowly learning and reconnecting more about Amber, and I found that to be sweet. Although I thought this story was sexually charged, and sweet, I found the storyline to be ok. I liked it, but didn't find myself connecting with certain scenes. Nevertheless, I would still recommend this book.Story: FAIRIntimacy: D.R.I.P = Don't Read In Public / GOODEnjoyment: FAIR to GOODRomance Novel Junkies","12 26, 2011",A2NUHWMHA9XNKV,Lady Raven RAVE!,;0),1324857600

Everything was . . . just okay.It could have been a whole lot more.I liked the whole premise. Young innocent man kicked out of his house must turn to being a whore at a place called the Chicken Ranch to survive, and his first client is a shy hunk with a stutter. So far so good. And the first part of this was nice; I liked the initial scene between the two of them.But from there, things remained relatively flat. Young sets up this hunky but nerdy guy with a stutter, but in the entire book I think he only stutters once, and it&#8217;s not really a problem. I wanted to see more drama, more tension, just more than a saccharin-sweet tale. That&#8217;s pretty much what the book was. There weren&#8217;t really any levels other than one fight, and I never really felt much for the characters. So much potential for inner struggles, but it just wasn&#8217;t there.So if you want a low stress, sweet romance, you&#8217;ll enjoy this.

No further books at this time.Books 4 and 5 are available as a paperback anthologyAnimal Attraction.Plot:Now that Gabe has returned to town, Sarah needs to decide if she can trust him enough to give him her HEA.Comments:- Contemporary paranormal (shape shifting) SmallTown romance with explicit bedroom scenes.- 2272 kindle locations, 30,000 words, but finishes around 1940 locations.- m/f - explicit, reasonably frequent. Light bdsm including D/s, bondage, spanking.- Sarah has made cameo appearances in previous books. Gabe has also played roles as the town Sheriff and Adrian's Second. Events that occurred in Book 3, during Sheri's troubles, are referenced and affect The Senate's choice of Gabe as a Hunter.- ""Only in my Dreams"" starts within days of the destruction of the rogue wolves in Book 3.- Includes excerpts fromCabin Feverby Alisha Rai,Dance on the Wilde Sideby Beverly Rae, andVery Much Aliveby Dana Marie Bell.Opinion:I didn't like this story as much as I have the others in the series. It is pretty much all relationship-driven as Gabe tries to work out what he did wrong, and Sarah tries to forgive him. But too much of it just didn't gel for me, from Sarah being really, really hurt, and then rapidly forgiving him, to her inability or unwillingness to use her Super Senses to just work out what the heck is going on!!! And there seemed to be a big chunk of the book missing while Gabe went off to learn to be a Hunter. Is this a teaser to yet another series? Otherwise, it felt like an artificial roadblock put in the way of their happiness.On the plus side, I loved the karaoke scene, really enjoyed visiting with past characters, and thought the trip to Disney World was a nice touch. The bdsm aspects were tastefully done and Sarah and Gabe are very sweet together.Bell has set in motion her new ""Halle Shifters"" series as she introduces more shifter types into Halle. Gabe's ""friend"" Chloe plays a large role inBear Necessitieswhen her brother and cousin come to visit. It is nice to see her World developing, from coyotes in New York to Wolves in Poconos and now Bears and Foxes in Halle. It looks like an interesting, complex paranormal world. Definitely an author to keep an eye on.Overall, this is a good paranormal series with erotic tendencies. The books are reasonably short and mostly relationship-driven, with small dramatic plots to keep the stories running.  But in the end I just wasn't enamoured of this one. I wasn't sure if I really wanted Sarah to stay with Gabe, or stay quite so readily.

I enjoyed the premise of three friends on a weekend in wine country, CA.  The description of the vineyards and town made me want to visit the area.  Each character has about 1/3 of the book devoted to her; each story within the book was very good and different.  I loved the first two characters in the first and second parts: Carrie and Rose . . . absolutely fell in love with the chef for more reasons than one, gee he cooks!  Rose's story was the most believable to me (though who really cares how believable it was).  Vanessa was my least favorite character, matter of fact; I really didn't care for her at all until the end, then I changed my mind about her.  However, FOR ME, Vanessa's weekend was by far, one of the most erotic stories I have ever read . . . the words, scenarios and feelings portrayed were beautiful; at one point, I had tears running down my cheeks because the writing was so poignant . . . wow!

He's desperate and this leads him to a decision he never thought he'd have to make, to become a rent boy at the local all-male brothel, the Chicken Ranch. Killian Hamilton is a 30 year old accountant. He is good looking and successful at his profession but social awkwardness keeps him lonely. He avoids dating so a drive out to the rural brothel that he just heard about seems like an easy way to satisfy his sexual needs. His visit happens to occur on Declan's first night of work and he is the one who takes Dec's virginity, although Killian doesn't know this at the time. This was a one-time occurrence. Months pass and Declan becomes good at his job but he never means to make this a career. He begins taking a few courses at the local community college. Miller returns to his lonely existence. Then the two happen to run into each other at a grocery store and they decide to meet outside the ranch in hopes of fostering a friendship that both need in their lives. An attraction is there and soon they are dating. Declan works hard to pull his life together and build a future away from prostitution. Killian steadfastly stands by his man being patient, understanding and loving--- all difficult to do in the face of his reality. I do find it a little hard to believe how little an impact on his life is the fact that Declan is a male prostitute. I mean of course it affected his relationship with Killian. Killian, who had little self-confidence to be begin with, struggled with the fact that Declan was constantly having sex with men who might be better than him in any and all departments. Jealousy is a real bitch to tame! But outside of this personal relationship, Declan went to work, went to school, went on with his life with no apparent repercussions from his type of employment. It just seems a little bizarre to me. Still, this is a fast, interesting read with flawed but oh-so-likeable characters who get their happy ending in a believable way. That's not an easy thing to say when discussing a male prostitute working at a place called the Chicken Ranch! Considering where Declan was in his life at the beginning of the story, the end is that much sweeter. This is a good book and I cannot wait to read the next installment in this new series!Roux's 4 sweet pea review appears mrsconditreadsbooks.com/index.php/?p=12151","06 19, 2013",A3P4BJ6GBH7KIW,Becky C,Rent boy story,1371600000

6228,29300,B0045EOK9Y,"[2, 5]",2,"""The Door at the Top of the Stairs"" was written by Alison Holt.  This appears to be a third book for Ms. Holt and a departure from her previous two detective mystery novels. The current novel is of the psychological thriller genre. The book is written in conversational dialog spoken by the characters. The writing is straight forward and does not offer any degree of complexity in structure which should be generally acceptable by a wide audience.The story is about a young female police officer, ""Jesse Shaunessy"" twenty six years old, who was dismissed from the police force after five years of service. The police psychologist assessed Jesse to be too traumatized to continue to serve. Jesse was an undercover narcotics agent. She witnessed her partner ""Pete"" accept a bribe and sell her out to a narcotics dealer who subsequently tortured her in retaliation for shooting his brother.Jesse, looking for work, shows up at the horse farm run by 57 year old Morgan Davis and her 65 year old life partner Dr. Ryland Caldwell. Ryland is a retired psychologist who after observing the odd behavior (and physical scars) on Jesse, engages in her rehabilitation. The story of Jesse's abduction and torture is then revealed through a series of ""regressive sessions"" devised by Ryland as therapy.  While this is all going on, there is a secondary plot afoot being crafted by one Cody Maitland, a college dropout, hired by Morgan as a favor to her neighbor, Cody's father. Cody is featured as a plainly despicable young man bent on causing Jesse to get fired through his plotting of nefarious incidences that Jesse will be blamed for.At about the time that Jesse is recovered from her therapy, the story, in an unexpected twist of events, culminates in the conclusion of the drama and some additional revelations about Jesse and her ordeal.There were a number of things about this book that I did not care for. The character of Jesse and Morgan were a bit too overdone for my likes. While Jesse may have had some reason for her incorrigible behavior, Morgan's was not comprehensible in comparison. Further, I thought the male attributes applied to Morgan made her look foolish at times. The description of Richard as a ""brilliant"" narcissistic killer also seemed misplaced. There was nothing revealed about Richard that lead the reader to conclude that he was ""brilliant"".  Quite the contrary, he came across as decidedly evil, but not particularly bright as evidenced by a number of silly misjudgments.  The Character of Cody seemed equally misplaced. It was uncharacteristic for a young man like Cody to have harbored a hatred so thoroughly consuming as to result in his destruction. That's not to say it couldn't happen, just that there was no particular background given about Cody that explained his behavior and thus left the reader to his own conclusions. Finally, I did not find any appreciation of the life style portrayal of the female characters. While there is nothing inherently wrong (a non-religious view) with such a portrayal, I didn't find it necessary to advance the story. Certainly there have been many good books written with characters of alternate life styles, but these almost entirely are about the characters as persons and not about their life style per se. In this case, the depiction of all the females in the story as lesbian did not offer any necessary structure to the drama. If Morgan had been Martin, it wouldn't have mattered. Unfortunately for me, some of the intimate descriptions made me decidedly uncomfortable - as in the same realm as imagining 26 year old Anna Nicole Smith with 88 year old J. Howard Marshall II.....creepy.Overall I would recommend this novel only with reservations. I think there are underlying issues with it that would disenfranchise too many readers.","03 20, 2011",A3BOS84MY1SC3E,Max Read,A second look at this Novel,1300579200

9036,2190,B001DX54F4,"[1, 2]",4,"This review will follow the I-Review format aka Question & Answer format.Visitor: What made you pick up Consumed by Moira McTark?MBR: I was just browsing through Amazon, wondering which title from my massive TBR pile I should read next when this little number caught my eye with its pretty cover. After reading the blurb I had a major case of excitement over the story and the next thing I knew I was reading the preview of the book available on Amazon which just whetted my appetite for more and before I knew it I had hit the ""Buy now with 1-Click"" button and the rest, as they say is history!Visitor: Tell me a little bit about the hero Brian Matthers.MBR: Brian comes from a family of 3 brothers and 2 sisters and works in accounting at Dyson & Dale. Playing baseball in high school had been the high light of his life back then. Brian is intensely sexy and just sheer dynamite when it comes to wooing a woman in bed and out of it and I would love me some Brian as my next ""no-occasion-present."" And on top of it all, Brian has got that tender quality that makes a woman go all mellow on the insides. A man who is not afraid of long-term relationships and commitment, Brian is the reason why we women read romance novels! *sigh*Visitor: Now tell me a little bit about the heroine Amber Grayson.MBR: Amber works as a programmer at Claybourn Elliot and yearns for her own happily ever after though she knows that with the high standards that she has set since high school, the man who would fulfill all her dreams and longings is a long time coming. Amber is beautiful, sexy and knows what she wants and is not afraid to say what she wants as she has gained confidence as a woman over the years though she had been pretty shy in high school.Visitor: How does Brian and Amber meet for the first time?MBR: There is no mention in the novella of how Brian and Amber meet for the first time. But rather, Brian had been Amber's high school crush, a crush that had turned into the center-point of all her wicked fantasies throughout the years. And when a chance meeting at the train station brings Amber and Brian together again, both discover that the incredible pull between them is just too much to turn away from.Visitor: What was it that drew you into the story with Consumed?MBR: Mmm.. Consumed is a pretty well rounded novella that captured my attention and held it from page 1. Reading it one sitting tells just how much the story consumed me as Brian and Amber gave into the explosive passion between them and worked through the hurdles to reach their happily ever after. What drew me in most was the incredible connection that forges between Brian and Amber and even when things head south based upon a misunderstanding, neither Brian nor Amber can turn away from the incredible way that they can make each other feel. That I would say makes for a very heady and enticing pull towards any romance.Visitor: What was it that you liked about Consumed?MBR: As I said earlier, Consumed is a story that refuses to let go once you sink yourself into what's happening. For me, I loved everything about the novella from its beautiful glossy cover to its beautiful yet short epilogue that gave me a sense of satisfaction all around when I finished reading. What I loved most about Consumed was how smoothly the story flowed through, urging me to read on and find out where Amber and Brian were going with their no holds barred sexual relationship. And of course, the creative scenes of passion are just to die-for!Visitor: What if anything would you change about Consumed?MBR: Being a story of such short length, I would say it pretty much hit all the right spots with what the story delivered.Visitor: Any memorable scenes/quotes from Consumed you would like to share?MBR: Incredibly hot was the scene on the dance floor where Brian takes Amber upon her request making all breathe whoosh out of me in one single exhale. And the variety of sensual scenes that Moira delivers, making each one a memorable one is all I can say without giving away any details.Visitor: Who would you recommend Consumed to?MBR: Consumed is an awesome read to squeeze in if you have got around an hour and half to spare. For those who love reunion romances and intense, scorching passion without being overly explicit, Consumed is a definite must-read!Rating=4.5/5Reviewed by Maldivian Book Reviewer","08 5, 2011",A576L6YAOW6IP,"maldivianbookreviewer ""Book Reviews - From th...","Great, hot and quick read!",1312502400

3817,3681,B001XURN06,"[45, 48]",5,"John Galsworthy (1867-1933) was a very popular writer at the turn of the 20th Century.  He was the son of a wealthy lawyer and studied law at Oxford. He became a solicitor in 1890 but never practiced law.  Instead he used his father's wealth to travel and learn about writing fiction from talented authors including Joseph Conrad.In the Forsyte Chronicles, Galsworthy created the history of an extended family that begins in the Victorian era in Britain in the early 1800s, extends through the Eduardian Era in the latter decades of the 1800s, and ends after World War I during the British social and economic turmoil of the 1920s.The Chronicles, now called the Forsyte Saga, is a trilogy of novels: The Man Of Property (1906), In Chancery (1920), and To Let (1921).  The fist in the series sets the stage with wealth earned through the driving motivation of land ownership by the founding fathers of the Forsyte family.  The actors on the stage have landed riches and establish social networks as cohesive as the royal family in England.  Even their relationships are governed by the limits of ownership.  Women are the property of their husbands and accept their roles with the reward of financial security.In Chancery describes the continued accumulation of wealth of the family obtained through careful management of money increasingly independent of private property. There is an unwritten family rule of 4% return on all investments. Social conventions begin to change in the story with the problems brought on by allowing outsiders into the family's closed system through marriages. The women become somewhat rebellious refusing to accept many of the subservient roles that were accepted in the early generation Forsytes.To Let traces the family's fortunes through the turn of the 20th Century as the newer generations begin to consume rather than generate family wealth. This is a time of social and legal conflicts for the family that disrupt the order of their traditional lives.  The focus gradually changes to the youngest members of the family who, because of the devastating effects of the World War, believe that there is more to life than hoarding of riches, commodities that can disappear quickly.  These Forsytes pursue artistic and social justice activities and use the family money to go their own ways. The 4% rule is not forgotten, but rather never known by the youngsters.I first read the Forsyte Chronicles paperbacks in the early 1970s as a young man just out of the U. S. Army after the Vietnam War.  I enjoyed reading and experiencing the stability of the family and social structure of British society in the novels, a real contrast to my life then in California.  I identified with the last generations of Forsytes in To Let, focusing on their individual self actualizing choices.After rereading the trilogy on my Kindle1, I now identify with the more conservative earlier generations of Forsytes described in The Man of Property and In Chancery. I appreciated the change of perspective as I approach retirement, and I gained insight through a life review by proxy. I can relate the work to other great generational novels depicting the turn of the 20th Century, such as Thomas Mann's Buddenbrooks.The world is much more interactive now than it was in the Forsyte's mystical Great Britain, and social stress has taken on global proportions.  But the activities of making a living, maintaining family stability, and attempting to reach personal satisfaction remain great themes for the turn of the 21st Century.  I highly recommend the Forsyte saga to readers (especially Kindle readers) who will see that the endless cycles of social life continue and personal development is a product of these social rhythms.","01 28, 2010",A2KJZXIXBHVG0K,Gary Severance,Possession and Obsession,1264636800

Especially since neither character is white.Unfortunately the story didn't live up to its promise.I did like the start of the book, although I did think it somewhat boring. The author spends a lot of time setting the scene and describing the life of a Chinese worker building the railroads for a pittance and the life of a black single woman trying to build a new life and a business for herself and her friend. Bias, racism, sexism, it's all there and prevalent in the vernacular.As if that's not enough to create obstacles to the couple's happiness, there's also their inability to fully understand each other. Quiang speaks but a little English and he and Leah have to communicate through gestures, looks, and touches.There's all this, and what does the author do with it? Nothing. Cullars glosses over all the difficult--and rewarding--steps of a meaningful relationship building and focuses on the paper thin physical attraction instead. There's a brief mention of how Leah and Quiang learn to communicate with the help of a dictionary, but they don't really talk to each other. When they're together they're either taking their clothes of and having sex or putting their clothes on and thinking about having sex. And those sex scenes are bad. There's creaming and there's tumescence, there's orbs and there's the infamous ""her sex"" euphemism.After all that, the story and my rating for it could have been saved had I bought Quiang's interactions with the triad members. I can't really pinpoint my problem with them, but something in the language used left me unconvinced. It wasn't just Wao's refusal to call an erection an erection, it was also how the revelation of the misappropriation was handled. Until then, I had liked Quiang's willingness to engage in shady businesses for quick profit and that both characters had such defined lives outside each other, after it just felt anticlimactic.I didn't want a happily ever after epilogue, I wanted to read how they get there.So what does the book have? Good historical description with nascent characterisations, but without any real character or relationship development, and a whiff of Wild West adventures. It simply wasn't enough for me.","11 26, 2012",A28CZRO0PHRYQA,rameau,Utter disappointment.,1353888000

I have now read 4 of these books and previously thought that the ""Iron Duke"" was the weakest however I do not think this one is as good. It is a very short story probably best described as fantasy; from the cover picture I thought it was going to be a ""spaceship"" type science fiction.

And that's the only reason why I don't rate it 5 stars to be honest.This book is a first-contact book, but it's much better thought out than most other of the genre. There are logical reasons why there hasn't been much if any contact before, and there are logical reasons why when contact is established, it's found that the universe is filled with life and other sentient species.I found the science parts to be just enough to make it believable, and I have real respect for the care the author has taken in making the world seem logical and plausible. In addition, he doesn't turn to magic or 'just how things are' in order to solve something which can't be solved in any other way. Except - of course - for the end, which I'll get back to.The politics of earth are logical as well. I see some have reacted badly to the US being perceived as the 'bad guys' - but to me, the US here are the good guys, they simply can't trust the bad guys on earth and the natural conclusion to that, is that things get worse not better. But, I don't see it as the fault of the US or the western nations - I see it as a natural conclusion of the tension between nations, and that some of the 'bad' states simply can't be trusted. Normally, this sort of politics don't work for me in science fiction, but here - it does. Because the author doesn't condemn unnecessary, instead he logically points out the differences where they are, and let the logical conclusions happen - even when they are bad.And I do enjoy the characters, and how they interact and what their abilities let happen.But ... the end feels forced. The author does resort to 'magic' or 'faith' or 'God' or whatever you want, to let it happen. And ... I feel that everything is wrapped up too neatly.(SPOLER ALERT)It simply feels to me like the author took parts of the ending of watchmen and tried to make it work but without the emotional impact or the vilification of an outside source. It feels too easy to me, and how everything is neatly fixed and everyone falls in line, through what in my eyes is basic manipulation. People simply don't change their minds that fast, and I have a real hard time believing that the majority of the aliens would change their opinions that fast when they don't have the incentive that humanity does).(SPOLER END).In the end, I give it 4 stars and I recommend checking it out.

She's been making goal oriented lists her entire life and never once has she failed to reach each milestone and feel a sense of accomplishment as she marks it off the `TO DO LIST.'  For the first time ever her goal of a plush corner office and her name on the letterhead of the law firm where she's been working has her considering altering her plans.  She's been working eighty hour weeks for the past year and Belle's just beginning to realize that the perks of her desired position may not be worth the sacrifices she's made.Rafe Bettencourt, Belle's brother Brian's best friend, has been a longstanding friend of the family and the object of Belle's fantasies since she was twelve years old.  It wasn't until five years ago that he began to view her as a desirable woman - before that she was simply Brian's little sister and a whole lot of fun to torment.  Rafe's perfectly aware of Belle's anal retentive, control freak nature but that's a trait he's begun to find very alluring about her - there's nothing he'd like more than to strip her naked and make her lose control.For the first time in a year, Belle has returned home to visit with her family for the holidays.  She's thinner and paler than she had been on previous visits and everyone points out the fact that she's had no time for herself, family, or anything else that makes life worth living.  Belle's perfectly aware of that fact but she's come so far and is so close to her goal - quitting now is simply inconceivable.  Rafe proves to be a delightful distraction from her own troubles as he tempts her to be naughty with him.  What better time to start up a little romance than Christmas and seeing as she'll be visiting for a full five days, he's determined to give her a good reason to make some adjustments to her `TO DO LIST.'  Adjustments that include him, a happily ever after, and all the organizing and list making she could ever desire - as long as he can seduce her into giving up her `dreams' of success in San Francisco.  Or had she already been coming to the conclusion that there's more to life than a corner office and empty apartment all on her own?  Rafe just may provide that extra push she needs to take the leap of faith and move one of her long term goals up a few notches.Lauren Dane will have readers smiling with this delightful tale of hope and promise.  TO DO LIST captures Belle's single-minded pursuit of her dreams and her lists with humor and a little sadness.  There's no doubt that she's well on her way to acquiring her goal, but she also realizes that it isn't worth giving up her `real' life to achieve and accepting that she isn't going to get to cross that goal off her list is difficult to accept.  Rafe is willing to accept Belle exactly as she is - organized shoes and all - but he's also aware that the path she's on is a destructive and lonely one.  Rather than try to tell her what she should do he presents her with feasible options which may make her happier.  I had a great time reading TO DO LIST especially since I'm guilty of making these infamous lists myself.  I loved the family aspect of this story and the way it makes you see that there are more important things in life than reaching every goal you set for yourself - there's health, family, love, and your own happiness.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","03 19, 2008",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

My Kindle subscriptions, delivered via the Kindle app on my iPad, save me from myself.  Instead of hunting down magazines at the bookstore--or wondering where they disappeared to from the mail--I just wait for them to show up.  Nice, low-fuss delivery.  And then instant reading gratification.Analog has about half of the science fiction content of its competitor.  It makes up for this with more information from the ""Fact"" side of the fence.  The factual articles, editorials and letters to the editor are interesting and occasionally very interesting.  They wouldn't stand on their own, but are worth the subscription price when bundled with the fiction.My personal take:  I like reading on devices like the iPhone and iPad that also hold a lot of legitimate, technical information.  Maybe I'm just kidding myself when I think I'm getting away with it, but I do enjoy reading Analog and Asimov's in a long, boring, all-hands work meeting.The recommendation:  If you only subscribe to one Kindle magazine for science fiction, make it [Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine].  If you have the extra time, subscribe to this magazine as well.  It's a good complement with a real-science emphasis less present in Asimov's.","08 21, 2011",ACT2AA008KB31,"John M.

It's not superior storytelling; I would have liked more character development on both sides, and the dialogue is not great.

Nope, same night.It's a case of something very minor--the author using a tampon excuse to get the heroine alone to be kidnapped--turning into a major case of oops.  An editor should have spotted it.

What she doesn't' count on is meeting the two others who are there at the same time.  She meets Keil and his brother and is instantly drawn to Keil.Keil is in the process of fighting for alpha of his pack.  He and his brother are taking some time away from the pack to regroup.  Keil never expects to find his mate, and in a woman who doesn't even know she is a wolf.  Suddenly everything seems to be happening to him at once...  Not quite the relaxing time he expected.  Will Keil and Robyn mate?  Will Keil win the alpha challenge?Wolf Signs takes an interesting twist to the normal wolf meets girl story.  Robyn is unique as she is deaf.  I found the premise of this story fantastic.  I love to see ""non perfect heroines"".  There is great potential for this series as we meet many lovable characters in Wolf Signs.

Teams are disappearing on missions, yet events that demand their attention are on the rise in frequency and intensity. After sending out every spare group of people, even the main office's administrative staff, they bring in a misfit crew to investigate a mysterious phone call received just that day from an agent who disappeared 20 years ago from a small town called Excelsior Springs.Set in the modern day, this story is not focused on Egyptian mythology, despite the description and the intro chapter. I found this to be action-packed and interesting. The banter between the teammates is natural and often humorous. The setting in Excelsior Springs, including the history involved, is also impressive. I was surprised and pleased with the historical fiction aspects of the story, many of which involved this little town. It was clever to link a famous historical figure with O4S, though I don't want to say who the figure is due to spoilers. The old hotel and the alternate old hotel are both extremely creepy, especially due to the creatures and ghosts that inhabit them.Murphy, Bill and Kate are my favorites from the team. Murphy, the detective, is a sceptic; even after he finds himself transported to another dimension, he still refuses to believe, though he deals with what he's experiencing. Bill monitors, records and coordinates the efforts of the team as they investigate. He pops in with humorous remarks and seems to be their tether to the real world. Finally, Kate, the apprentice mage who thought she was simply coming for her first training mission, instead finds herself on a desperate mission, facing terrifying enemies.And those terrifying enemies are numerous and varied. Counted among them are ghosts, demons, immortal serial killers, and the particularly nasty spirit that spawned The Order of the Four Sons in the first place.Overall, I really enjoyed this story, particularly the historical fiction and the ongoing battle between good and evil. This is the first in a series, so the book ends off with a set up for the next one. I'd recommend this book for those who like books with interesting characters, historical tie ins, and cameos by famous (and infamous) historical figures.

You're not going to deflect a 12-foot hill giant's club the size of a punching bag with a sword, even if it is to ""make contact"".  You're not going to recommend gathering intelligence on the enemy, then sit on your butt for two days in the fort waiting for them to besiege you.

The Darkest Prison is the first novella right after Reyes and Danika's story in The Darkest Pleasure (they have a cameo at the very beginning actually). The book follows Atlas and Nike, god and goddess of Strength. The way it starts really has you questioning the romance between these two. I honestly thought I read the synopsis wrong because they did not like each other at all.We find out very quickly that Atlas is quite the ass. I did not like him because he basically acted like a scorned frat boy. Nike hates him because he used her and threw aside like trash. But Atlas finds that once Nike is in a cage with her ex-fiance, they both try to one up the other even though Atlas says he doesn't even find Nike attractive.I love seeing how their hate for each other developed into something past lust. They both stopped being stubborn and/or forget the past and saw they were the perfect match. I especially loved how Atlas changed his views of Nike and didn't treat her like the prisoner he kept her as. Even though it might get him in trouble with Cronus who doesn't care at all for his Greek prisoners (duh). Not to mention that ending. It really put a smile on my face. Nike puts the bad in badass.Nonetheless, this was a fun and sexy short read. It can be read without reading the main books in the series, but I wouldn't recommend that.

It's hard to explain what I hated about this book without specific references to what DIDN'T happen. No plot summaries. Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL: Disappointing book 2 of the Halle Pumas paranormal romance series that starts withThe Wallflower: A Hunting Love story, Halle Puma Series Book 1.. You HAVE to read book 1 first as this one starts during the climax of that book. While I am a fan of Ms. Bell's work, I have to tell you I am REALLY disappointed with this book. Book 1 was overly simplistic, but I could forgive that because it was book 1- this book was a step backwards entirely. I'm not even sure why this story got to be its own book. It could have been just an additional chapter or two in book 1.CHARACTERS: It is possible for characters to be UN-DEVELOPED? Simon and Becky are both great characters- but they were developed more in Book 1 than in this book ABOUT THEM. In fact, many of their mannerisms from book 1 disappeared and they became just cardboard cut-outs of what any couple in any shifter romance story could be. The tension between them evaporated- they were dancing around each other before, afraid and uncertain. Simon was artistic and a ladies' man and Becky was the shy, well-grounded partner in her store, but none of those characteristics were apparent in this story. They actually LOST their personality.PLOT: There was even LESS plot here than the product description implies. This was basically a continuation of book 1. There was no additional storyline. No additional conflict. No new bad guys. No new obstacles. It looked like Becky might have a long road to recovery after the attack- she needed to heal and to come to terms with what happened and finding out about the pumas... and that was all resolved in a couple paragraphs. Becky wasn't mad. She wasn't scared. She wasn't even badly injured. She didn't resist Simon. She didn't play hard to get. Simon didn't have to woo her or apologize. Simon supposedly had been a ladies' man- but even THAT didn't become an issue. No confrontation with Belinda or other exes. No discussion around why they never dated or expressed interest in each other sooner... NOTHING!!! More happened between these two in book 1 than here. It takes exactly one minute for Becky to just accept the existence of werecats, the fact that she's Simon's mate, and the fact that she has been turned into one.Like Max with Emma, Simon changed Becky into a puma without warning and without asking permission. She didn't complain- not ONE word of protest. She wasn't concerned about what it might mean for her life. She wasn't even surprised. Seriously, that's just absurd. If for no other reason than it could have offered something more substantial for the story!!!There was a very bizarre plot element of having Becky able to tell when the phone was going to ring before it did. What on earth was that about? It was cute, but didn't come to anything.BOTTOM LINE: This book was infuriatingly dull. I would tell you not to bother reading it, except I expect you probably need to if you want to bother with the rest of the series. I'm not really sure I do at this point. Ms. Bell's The Grey Court series is MUCH better than this one- at least it has a plot.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. Vivian Arend'sWolf Signs: Granite Lake Wolves, Book 1fun, light were-romance series2.

Sometimes you get a great short story and sometimes, as is the case with Maggie Casper's Christmas Cash , you get a dud. I picked this one up as a freebie, and a so happy I did.The Plot: Noelle (see the Christmas theme here?) has moved back home to Chaos, Texas and needs a job. Cash, her best friend's older brother (his whole family has C-names, and I didn't bother to learn any of the rest of them as it got very confusing in only 54 pages) refuses to let her work at his bar (or whatever the place is; it's never actually defined exactly), so she starts off as a bell-ringer dressed as a sexy Mrs. Santa across from where he lives and works.Which is strange, because the Salvation Army bell ringers here are all volunteer. Are they NOT in Texas?At any rate, she continues to annoy him, he continues to ramp up his handsy moves -- because he just can't resist her, you know -- and she finally takes a job at a Hooters-like bar that's competition for whatever his family-owned business is.Well, he can't have that. So he has to sex her up properly. And because this is labeled BDSM, he spanks her.To be honest, in this current culture, a simple spanking is a little tame to be labeled as BDSM in my book, but to each their own.Keeping in mind that this is a 54-page short story that begins with Cash turning her down for a job and a ramping up of their sexual escapades, how would you expect this to end? Yes, folks, that's right. You can take it to the least logical conclusion and there you are.Once I scraped my exploded head off the walls, I gave it two stars for the promised sex, zero stars for plot and character, and called it a day. It was a decent freebie if you are just looking for some sex scenes, but I would have been disappointed had I paid for it; there wasn't really much story to it at all.A version of this review appeared previously on Goodreads.","09 15, 2012",AHFC75JG6HV54,C.

The novel opens with Cato, a gangling teenager, inducted into the Roman Army in Germany with a letter of introduction from Rome insisting that he immediately be made a Centurion.  General Vespasian balks at this notion but compromises by making Cata an ""Optio"" which is essentially a Centurion's second in command and assistant.  Macro and Cato's skills compliment one another since Macro is illiterate, which he takes pains to conceal, while Cato is a bookworm.  Most of the novel deals with Cato's coming of age as a competent Roman soldier and fighting-man.The writing in this novel is quite good, the plot is linear without becoming too passe, and the characterizations are very good.  The author does a good job giving the reader a flavor for what it must have been like to be a Roman soldier in post-Republican Rome.

Sadly, this is not one of them.The premise of Daughter of Deception is promising, and I was looking forward to discovering the different types of demons as Duke and Viola hunted.  I was unable to finish the book for a few reasons.1.  Like so many indie books, the lack of effective editing made it nearly unreadable.  I'm not saying responsibility doesn't lie with the author, but when you have an untried writer, a good editor makes all the difference.  Thorpe had many errors in tense, which became worse further into the book.  A sentence that made it past the copy editor: ""Viola shifted her grip on the knife's hilt, fights fought a wave of nausea..."" makes it obvious the author struggled with tense.2.  Her characters were inconsistent, so it was difficult to pick out motivations.  Viola expends a great deal of effort to get back in the Network, then quits after her first job?  She starts out self-assured and sharp, but quickly becomes something of a mess.  I wondered where the interesting heroine portrayed in the sample went.3.  Brief, unwarranted shifts in point of view were disorienting.  It really doesn't matter that much what Olivia thinks when on the phone with Viola.  Just stick with Viola.  Omniscience almost never works.Thorpe absolutely shows promise.  She has imagination that will serve her well down the road.  In the meantime, she needs to spend a whole heck of a lot of time in critique groups, getting her house in order before she publishes again.","08 25, 2010",A2H9JE8YGL44VH,Catherine Winterfox,Another one for the editor,1282694400

11074,10601,B0031Y9DMI,"[2, 2]",3,"This review is a bit contradictory because what I loved about this story, made it quite lacking at well.*SPOILERS*The excerpt does a good job describing the story and how the hero (Xenos) was throughout the book, I loved that he was an alien crossbreed who looked and behaved like it. So many times, I've read the 'lazy- I-don't-want-make-my-audience-uncomfortable-version' of sci-fi romances where the only things alien about the characters are their names and customs!nLike the excerpt states, Xenos is jaded and hardened emotionally and I like that the author remained true to that definition of who he was. He grew up in a lab where he was tortured, experimented on, and reared where he never had any positive emotional contact with anyone. And, because of how he looked, he was always on guard with everyone. Moonlight entered the picture, offering him her body for her mother's freedom, but she was disgusted and revolted by who he was and how he looked. Sure, her body responded to him sexually even though she hated, but he knew how she felt, so beyond the physical demands of his body, his overwhelming purpose was tied to his mission to defy his leaders and to stop the breeding and testing in the labs. So building on the sexual desire, Moonlight became interested in the Xenos the person. Now some readers might see her interest as being one-sided as she made most of the overtures in the relationship, but while I do get that sometimes as readers we want to see reciprocity to 'even' a relationship, in this case I understood why it couldn't be so. To accept the relationship, you had to remember who Xenos was, how he grew up and the events that shaped his life. He never knew love, tenderness,acceptance, or even a relationship and he also was insecure therefore all approaches had to come from Moonlight. Moonlight was strong in that she didn't need the scorecard. I thought that she took responsibility for the fact that SHE wanted him and in her internal dialogue, we see she accepted the challenges and came with being with someone who was so closed off.That being said, I think the author missed the mark with Moonlight's overall development. I didn't feel like I knew enough about her and it made her character a tad bit underwhelming.The story also focused too much on the rebellion/mission and even though Xenos and Moonlight's relationship was developing, it was merely based on their sexual compatibility. Every time they came together, it was about sex. This is my contradictory peeve, because while I like how focused the author was on maintaining Xenos character, the story ultimately is a romance, and there could've been a little more on the romance side without necessarily jeopardizing the storyline. Also, the sex scenes were very repetitive...in fact, after the first one, every other scene felt like it was cut and pasted with just a word change here and there. Xenos basically did the same things, Moonlight gasped the same words over and over!!There are a few graphic elements that a potential reader should be aware of. It's not too crazy or overly descriptive, but it is there.Finally, the end of the book left much to be desired. I felt like the author was detached from the romance side and it showed through in the end. Nevertheless, its a book that I recommend!","11 20, 2013",A3HF60HAA5XZPQ,"Addicted to my Kindle ""Romance Novel Junkie""","3.5 stars for a good story, but left me wanting!",1384905600

I liked the concept of this book but really Cooper was way too whiny for me to be able to deal with.  I still enjoyed the dark and crude humor that carried over from the first book but I didn't really care for the overall story or character development for this one.  It felt really flat for me and I didn't feel any real emotion at the end of the story.  I was just kind of glad I didn't have to read about Cooper anymore, he was just so annoying.  My thoughts on Cooper, however, had nothing to do with his love for computers or that his heaven is inside a computer.  Heaven is whatever you make it so I understand their ""ruling"" that Cooper is OK with where he is because at least he's moved on.  I love the idea that the author wrote this story about a total nerd who is so into video games.  But being a gamer myself and knowing many people who play the types of games that are referenced in this book, I found the stereotype gamer used in this story to be pretty insulting.  Linda, however, was awesome and I loved her reactions to the stupidity that was Cooper.  Because of that I completely related to her, I seriously just wanted to strangle Cooper through the whole story.  Too bad he was already dead.Conclusion:Least favorite out of the three by far but would recommend it if you enjoyed the first one and would like to continue reading about Linda.

Her decision to cut loose and celebrate her freedom from the crown and sash has landed her in big trouble.  The simple fact that she wakes up in a stranger's bed wearing nothing but her Miss Firecracker sash with no memory of how she got there is just the beginning of what promises to be a wild week.Wyoming sheepherder Blake West has been at loose ends since his father decided to retire and sell the ranch.  He jumped at the chance to manage his friend's bar in Nebraska while trying to decide what he wants to do with his life.  Blake is a genuinely nice guy but he's also got a domineering side and for Willow, the combination is intoxicating.Willow has always been more of a tomboy than a beauty queen but when a childhood nemesis entered her name into the contest she had too much pride to back out.  In a way she'd kind of hoped she'd learn to be more `feminine' but let's face it, `ladies' don't get drunk and bust up a bar.  The only thing that kept her from a jail cell is a condition she agreed to - to work at the bar until she's earned enough to pay for the damage she caused.Willow's definitely not happy with this situation, but there's no denying she's incredibly attracted to Blake.  When she thanks him for being such a nice guy and not taking advantage of her inebriated state the night before, Blake sets her straight and defuses any notion she has that he's not interested in her sexually.  Blake's only filling in for his friend at the bar for about a week so keeping any relationship they embark on a no-strings attached basis would only make sense, but the more time they spend together the more they realize that what they share is much more than just sex.Lorelei James' WILD WEST BOYS series has a new addition that is hotter than any 4th of July show.

Facing extinction as they struggle against escalating Antarean attacks, the proud warrior race begins the process of uniting with the Galactic Alliance to ensure their future.Captain Wulf Caradoc, as the heir of the Prime leader, is expected to assist with negotiations on behalf of his people.  The secret, secondary part of his agenda is to look for his gemate, the genetically ideal mate that will be bonded to him mentally, physically and emotionally until the end of his days.  The ambassadorial team he is assigned to escort is attacked by space pirates hired by Prime malcontents.  Despite their skillful defense tactics, Wulf, his crew, and their charges are in danger until Alliance forces can reach them.Captain Melina Dmitros is a top-notch Galactic Alliance officer who's paid her dues.  After receiving a distress message from the Prime ambassador party, she steps in to aid them.  When she finally meets the future Prime leader face-to-face, she is ambushed by the biological force of the Prime mating urge.  She is his gemate, his fated match and a Lost One.  Her body will not allow her to survive without him, regardless of how she feels.  Wulf is willing to do whatever it takes to claim and protect his mate so that they may persevere against their enemies.The action kicks up a dust storm in chapter one of Prime Obsession that never settles!  I was convinced that Captain Dmitros was a first-rate adrenaline junkie from all the non-stop battles.  I rarely encounter a novel with multiple action scenes per interval.  Melina takes on bad guys, dodges hits, sniffs out/repairs sabotages, and keeps time with her man.  It's all in a day's work for a woman that knows her way around the Prime as well as the Galactic Alliance.  Wulf is growls and nibbles when it comes to his mate, although he's more than earned his formidable Prime warrior and sex machine title.  However, Melina is always center stage and in the thick of it all.  I started to feel that she was beginning to upstage her man.  Ok, ok.  Admittedly, I do prefer strong, accomplished female antagonists.  Still, Melina proved a bit overwhelming at times.Wulf's growling seemed uh, well...ridiculous after a while.  I've read novels with alpha males expressing their protectiveness this way, yet the constant repetitiveness became excessive and silly after a while.  Of course, it was a relief to have Wulf take charge after watching Melina prove just how tough and skilled she is over and over again. I could better appreciate the developing relationship.  The author does an amazing job of revealing the awakening gifts from a gemat-gemate pairing. Once I got a grasp on the dynamic, it was okay for the plot to charge ahead.Prime Obsession is a fast-paced space opera outfitted in shiny new gadgets and modern characters.  If you're looking for a sci-fi novel brimming with loads of techno jargon, intergalactic intrigue and angst, you've come to the right place.  Melina and Wulf's chemistry decimates small planets.  The ""foreplay"" preceding their first time together behind closed doors covers way too much ground; it dangled on the storyline string a tad longer than I would have preferred.  The romance and dialogue occasionally feels dated, although I could appreciate some truly cute moments.  Monette Michaels' narrative style is clean and precise with crisp visuals that flow easily from scene to scene.  All in all, it's fun to be kept on the edge of your seat for the bulk of the ride.  That's no easy feat in a story with so many subplots and secondary characters.  If this is just the first installment, then the next episode will have to put in some major overtime to keep up.PatriceReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","01 22, 2010",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,Prime Obsession,1264118400

The visual descriptions and writing style are very, very good. The mystery falls into the cozy mystery style and is well thought out and plotted. The descriptions of flora and fauna are truly outstanding. Made this non-gardener want to go plant something.All that said, I did feel that Rachel and other characters could have been better developed. Personally, I probably would've enjoyed the book much more if I had gotten to know Rachel better. Hopefully, in future books of the series Rachel will be more fully developed and become more personable.I also wish the book had been longer. It reads more like a novella, which is fine, as it suited my mood at the time, but I think it should probably be labelled as novella rather than a novel. For me, a little more depth and length is required to truly merit the label novel and this lack of depth is what caused any disappointment I felt in the book.I liked Blind Malice enough,though, that I will certainly read more installments in the series and can recommend this first one to anyone who loves plants, flowers and gardening.

11300,12148,B0035LDNV4,"[3, 4]",3,"NO SPOILERS or plot summaries. Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL: Book 1 of a trilogy, Vampire-themed Urban Fantasy/Romance. Overall pretty entertaining- story pulled me in, I liked the characters. Vampire mythology standard, but intricately described- politics between ""Houses"" is important. Note this is pure vampire, so you don't have any human perspective- they are predators, pure and simple. While romance was a constant theme, it was not the central plot and there is no sex. Violence is fast and bloody, but not overly gruesome. BE WARNED: Cliffhanger ending. You have to read book two for the rest of the story! (I haven't yet, but hear it's an even better book.)PLOT: Fast paced, excellently set up. I was really into the story until the last 25%. Things started out very well done, but fell apart at the end. The characters were thrown together and ran all over Europe in a romantic adventure, but eventually you had to ask ... when were they going to get some SOLID INTEL? Going into the last battle, we STILL didn't know who we were fighting or why. It was unsettling and bizarre and it led to the cliffhanger ending. It was ALMOST a great book, but reading to a cliffhanger when even you as the reader knew there was a problem is just f-ing frustrating. (See? It even made me swear!) This story arc could have used a little extra thought.CHARACTERS: Although slightly wooden, I really liked both Valentine and Prophecy. I attributed their slightly wooden natures to the fact that they were highly vampiric and not human at all. Despite that, they were very sympathetic. It was heart wrenching and thrilling to watch them grow close and ride out their emotional turmoil. Very well done on that front. Romance is teasingly light with barely a kiss, making the next book all that much more important!BOTTOM LINE: DESPITE my annoyance with the holes in the plot, I really did enjoy most of this book. I fully intend to continue to read this series and I notice Heaton has written other books set in the same ""realm,"" so I'll eat those up too!RECOMMENDATIONS:1. Katie Salidas'Immortalis Carpe Noctem- girl is turned after an attack and then tries to adapt and cope with a little bit of guidance from a sexy vampiric savior2. Jocelyn Drake's vampire/were/demon centric series full of grit:Nightwalker (Dark Days, Book 1)3. H.P. Mallory'sFire Burn and Cauldron Bubble: The Jolie Wilkins Series, Book 1- poor young woman accidentally discovers creatively drawn world of fae, vampires, weres and more. Weaker female character, but still well written4.

I haven't read Colters' Woman since I'm not a big fan of siblings involved in a polyamorous incestuous relationship regardless if the siblings aren't sexually attracted to one another. In Colters' Wife, each Colter brother has one-on-one time with the pregnant heroine, Holly. There's no threesomes or quartet loving going on here.Colters' Wife goes as follows: Pregnant woman has sex with three brothers at different times, falls down a ditch, gives birth, The End. The sex was hot but there really wasn't much of a plot.When Holly fell down the ditch, I was expecting some Lassie type dog to run and get help. Unfortunately, no lovable dog appeared, and because of this I had to lower the grade because nothing says happily ever after like a woman married to three brothers and a pet dog they can all love and cherish. But then the dog wouldn't be able to sleep in their bed because there's no room with three brawny men and one small woman sleeping together.If you're a fan of Maya's Coulter series, you'll enjoy this short. It's both cheesy and equally disturbing having three brothers sharing one woman. Holly must be exhausted from all the Colter loving she gets.

Carey gave Brock's life purpose again and Brock wants to return happiness to the life of the man who quickly became his best friend.I found Coverboy to be more of a buddy story than a romance.  Brock had a frat boy persona.  He let his fame go to his head and ended up alienating those close to him.  Carey was a lifesaver for him.  I like the camaraderie between Brock and Carey, and even though their relationship was sexually physical, I didn't view them as a couple, but more so as friends with benefits.  Dan Skinner has a fun writing style and even though Coverboy wasn't what I was expecting I will look for more of Mr. Skinner's work.LeyReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","02 9, 2009",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,Coverboy,1234137600

Unfortunately, from the beginning I felt like this was the 2nd or 3rd book of a series. The background is sort of filled in eventually, but it takes almost the entire book to do so, including the 'bonus story.'While I do love the characters Count and Kara, everything else about the book was difficult to follow and enjoy. The flow of the plot was not smoothe. The other characters seemed unfinished. I don't normally mind being thrown in the middle of a setting with gradual background information released as I read, but the author did a poor job of intergrating the reader into his world at a good pace. The beginning was very busy and had a lot going on, only as a recap in his hospital stay, and THEN the reader is put into the present time, which is slow moving. The bonus story felt like another ""how I met this other character"" mini story that was put in at random fillers during the plot.Count and Kara are good characters. The others need more polish. The book as a whole seemed completely unorganized.

I found it very hard to believe that the main character could keep asking why the ""villain"" did this or that?

Why would she rush off to confront someone whom she suspects of fraud and murder, thus giving him plenty of time to cover his tracks? Her relationship with her lover is most unconvincing, as she asks him to wire her an enormous sum of money and agrees to marry him, but then doesn't bother to check her emails.The descriptions of the landscape take over pages of what should have been well-written mystery.

Aside from that, it was a pretty disappointing read, going swiftly downhill. The relationships between Robyn and the wolf brothers was too sudden, especially her attraction to Kail - there was no doubt in her mind, not even any sort of inner cautionary voice - no, the moment she saw him she literally turned into an uninhibited sex fiend. As for his poor brother... TJ's sole presence in the book was to be made a mockery of and treated as if he were some sort of clowning duffus to be gotten ridden of as soon as things got a little hot and heavy between the two protagonists. And even then - when her brother finds out the truth - it turns out he knew all along! And don't get me started on the sex scenes! Actually, do get me started. They were NOT SEXY. Do we really need descriptions of body parts? And oh, he's so well hung - well what a surprise - aren't all male protagonists? And I hate, hate, hate the word ""milked"". Please. No. Not when you're discussing sex. It's just... gross.This novel read like a pale shadow of a Nalini Singh book. The concepts were almost the same, the sexual tension similar (although Arend did not draw that out nearly enough for it to be particularly steamy). But, of course, with one major difference. Singh is a good author.And sexual tension not withstanding - there was no actual action tension either. The characters hardly seemed to be at risk for their life, and I think this was just someone's wolf fantasy.Oh, and what happened to the big fight? The actual ritualistic fight for alpha wolf. It just never happened - the story just finished! 13% from the end of the ebook, I was quite surprised.Arend, perhaps your work gets better as you go along.

Being the pushy, outgoing person she is (well, not really, but she's trying) and having heart-stopping ""lust"" for Nikos, she tries getting him to do more than grunt at her. Well, when that doesn't work, she goes off to her seat and is lured in by Klaus. Now, Twyla suspects Nikos is a vampire, and possibly Klaus, but has no solid proof. That is until Klaus puts the moves on her and almost inducts her into the ""Mile High Club"". Nikos is all over the both of them swearing to protect her and wrangling her away from Klaus. A trip in the Limo confirms her suspicions and has her begging for Nikos' bite. Boy is there a lot going on in Limo's in both Meier's Corners and New York City!

I'm not saying I judge their relationship, I just don't understand it and I don't want to read about it. If you like reading about all that and if you don't mind open-relationships, that's cool, but I prefer monogamous relationships over anything else and that's that. :-/It was great getting another installment of the guys, though. In the past, Angelo was my favorite character but, unfortunately, he's not anymore. He's actually my least favorite now and Matt is firmly at the top. Anyways, I liked the fact that we got to see Matt get a little more intimate with Jared in public (there's only a brief scene but still, it was sweet) and I liked the fact that Zach and Angelo get closer through their little 'kink'. It was nice how everything worked out in the end even if it wasn't the way I'd like it to have ended.I will say that I thought Angelo was a freaking hypocrite the way Zach let him fool around with other guys but he wouldn't let Zach do the same. And I also thought it was way out of character for Angelo to do that since in A to Z he was pretty gaga over Zach and didn't give any indication that he'd do something like that but that's just my opinion. At the beginning, I thought Angelo was walking all over Zach but it's clear by the end that Zach actually gets turned on by Angelo dancing with other guys and knowing that by the end of the day, Angelo will always be his. Still don't understand it but all power to them, right?I liked seeing pieces of Angelo's old personality and how he could pretty much lose anyone with how he just goes off topic and then back on it again. There was also brief spurts of humor I rather enjoyed and I especially enjoyed getting back into Matt's head again.All in all, I think this would have been a great book if the whole conflict of Zach and Angelo's sexual life would have been left out but that's just my opinion and because of that, I can't recommend this book.

Rae is a girl training to become a Cleric until one day she discovers she is a fairy. So, starts this book. The entire storyline takes place in 2 days but, oh boy! does a lot happen in 2 days. Rae is thrust into a war between 2 fairy factions, 2 love interests (the fairy named Breandan and the vampire named Tomas) and so on...I found the idea of the story interesting.

The grammatical errors, missing words, wrong words (at one point the author writes `right' when it should have been `wrong'), etc. made reading the book so distracting and frustrating that I could barely concentrate on the plot. I don't think I went 2 pages without encountering a mistake.Character development: Characters are largely undeveloped and have no depth, even the main ones. For example, we get very little in terms of interaction between Rae and her best friend Alex, so the events of the end did not have any effect on me whatsoever. We didn't get to care about Alex at all. We learned little about her, and only through Rae's narration. Basically, that is the problem, we learned everything from the author telling us than from the character development.Character interaction: I will make allowances for Rae's sudden trusting happy lovey dovey relationship with Breandan but, not with Tomas. We get no frame of reference, rhyme or reason as to why Rae is interacting with the vampire Tomas the way she is. From their first encounter to the second, there is a world of difference. I mean, talk about jumping the gun!Basically, this is a story with potential if the author decides to review it and expand on the book, fix the errors and get a good editor.

The internal dialogue was awesome--definitely my kind of entertainment with quite a few WTH moments.Romance: This is where it faltered, but I get the impression it wasn't truly meant to be a romance. In my humble opinion, it barely pushed the meter. I was halfway through the book before the two heroes decided to give any clear clues about their attraction. Sure, there were occasional hints, but nothing really substantial. It's like looking at an attractive guy walk down the street and thinking hmm..He's kind of cute. Really means nothing in the end.Eroticism: I have to be honest. It really didn't do it for me. I've never read M/M eroticism, but I've seen some racy scenes on TV which I loved. I don't know if it's because it's reading material and not visual stimulation which kept me from getting into the hot and bothered mode or not. I will say it was certainly interesting in a research type of way. I'm going to have to read a bit more M/M to see if it will actually get me excited.Realism: I had a bit of problems here. I don't hang out in the LGBT community. I've known a few lesbians, but no openly gay men. So I wonder if gay men really act like the guys in the novel or were they just stereotyped. I always figured gay folks lived lives like everyone else with everyday personalities. The MC and his buddy Sheppard seemed a bit dramatic at times. They kind of reminded me of characters who would play on Noah's Ark--a show I only managed to get through two episodes. Then again, Dan seemed like an everyday guy I'd meet on the street with human motives. I liked him, and I could relate to him. So I wonder; were the guys in this novel authentic? If not, I'd love to read a book where the gay people truly act the way people in the gay community/world would act. Leave me a note if you have any suggestions.The only true complaint I had with the novel was a couple of moments when I had no idea who was talking--tags just not properly placed. I made educated guesses about the speakers, and I suppose it didn't make too much difference as far as the story unfolded. Still, it would have been nice to know who said what.Thanks for the read LB Gregg!","07 12, 2012",AK08Z2F0T74JK,"Reena Jacobs ""Fiction Addict""",Not What I Expected but Still Decent,1342051200

A fun parody--even though trying too hard at times. Nothing heavy. Nothing that requires much attention/concentration. Nothing breath-taking and outstanding that will be remembered forever, but entertaining, nonetheless.On the other hand, it just was too much, at times--even though the book is intentionally cliched and over the top:Law is this alpha male of all alpha males. He's super talented, smart, intelligent, successful, powerful, dominant, rich, handsome, fearleass, brave, honourable, strong-minded. He's a billionaire. He's got the world laid out to his feet. Everyting he does or touches turns into gold. He might be a god..., he certainly feels and behaves like one. He's awfully arrogant or sure of himself--however you'd like to interpret it. When planning a picnic, he's using his helicopter or jet to get there, flying the thing himself, naturally. When confronted with a gun (while being unarmed himself) he fearlessly and single-handedly, and, of course, successfully--was there ever any doubt?--wrestles the gun-holding ""opponent"" for the gun, knocking him out easily while he's at it. And that's that. He joined the force and went to Afghanistan for no other reason than to kill Osama Bin Laden himself. While fighting bravely at the front for freedom and against terrorism, he's running his corporation via satellite (his private one, of course) and quite successfully so.In contrast to Law Tom--although being refered to as tough (why?)--can only be compared to a damsel in distress, helplessly waiting for the shining knight in armor to save the day or, which would be more appriopriate in Law's case, to save the world. I don't really like this kind of dynamic in a relationship, neither straight nor gay.And the rape-but-not-rape scene wasn't anything I liked very much, either. Tom was scared to death, waiting for the inevitable while trying to convince himself that it won't be all that bad, that it will be OK, and he just realizes that he's actually turned on as hell the second he feels Law's *** (or, to put it nice: member) up his virgin ***. That was too close for comfort. (A D/s [BDSM] dynamic is fine, even hot, but here it isn't. The thing between Law and Tom is not a D/s thing, not in that way.) I couldn't find anything remotely romantic in that.Yes, this book wants to be a parody, wants to be over the top. And it is working in some parts, but in others it isn't.Sometimes, less is more.","03 12, 2012",A342H4Z100C27A,"karlakolumna ""karlakolumna""","Sometimes, Less Is More. 2.5 Stars.",1331510400

This edition could still use some editing and the author has the annoying tendency of constantly identifying the characters rather than switching to he or she after the first few times. It pulled me out of the story occasionally but it's not a major issue. The sex does tend to go on for a while but there are some definitely hot moments. The whole scene with Luke in his ""monster"" form was pretty ridiculous but it didn't ruin the entire book for me. I got a little confused with all the characters thrown into this story (obviously to set up future books in the series) with 5 best friends including Lena plus Luke and his 2 buddies I couldn't really keep up with who's who when they all got together. There's a small bit of action in the story but Luke's quest to make this movie doesn't actually happen in this story, I'm sure it's going to be prolonged over the course of the series so be warned this is definitely a story about Lena and Luke's relationship or sex life really than anything else. I feel the author missed an opportunity to expand on the life and world of the monsters but overall I liked it for what it was and it's definitely good if your just looking for a little steamy bit of escapist fluff.","07 22, 2011",A1MV7V2HX2PE6Z,Rebekah Rae,More Erotica Than Action Suspense,1311292800

Nola is an Amazon warrior that has been cursed with invisibility after losing the same treacherous games. Now these enemies are finally coming together to break free of the curses that have befallen them. Well I wanted to read this novella immediately after finishing the Atlantis series, but I didn&#8217;t have an e-reader until now. I thought this would be amazing, heart stopping, satisfying romance novella. It was satisfying, but not heart stopping or amazing. I had really high expectations for this novella because I really liked Nola and Zane in The Vampire&#8217;s Bride.The main female character is Nola. Nola is a lot more likable in the novella. If you&#8217;ve read The Vampire&#8217;s Bride you&#8217;ll know how she pretty much ruined Zane&#8217;s life anyway she could get and absolutely hated and lusted after him. I like Nola, but compared to Delilah, her fellow Amazon, she wasn&#8217;t as strong as a character. She didn&#8217;t have a presence. She was there, but not really there; which is really ironic to say because of the curse. I didn&#8217;t even realize it until I thought about it. I&#8217;m a genius.Kick-Butt Heroine Scale: 7The main male character is Zane. I really liked Zane in The Vampire&#8217;s Bride. I was rooting for his happiness. I loved his attitude, but he seemed a lot more broken The Amazon&#8217;s Curse. It made it really hard for me to like him. I just didn&#8217;t like him as much. It was a bit of a letdown because I liked him a lot previously.Swoon Worthy Scale: 7The Villain- The Amazons are the villains. Really I didn&#8217;t care whether any of them lived or died. The Amazons know how to fight and we didn&#8217;t even get to experience the battle. Rip off.Villain Scale: 5Layel and Delilah made an appearance. They were just so cute together and they have a baby on the way! YAY!Character Scale: 7This novella was a huge letdown for me. I feel like if this was an actual novel it would&#8217;ve been so much better. The characters lacked their usual umph, the Amazons were terribly developed, and the romance wasn&#8217;t as heart stopping as it was last time. It also really bothered me how Nola went from loving her sisters to hating them all because of Zane. Then again she didn&#8217;t really like them all that much previously, but the change was still really fast.

I am currently hard at work on the fourth rewrite of my manuscript, and some of the best places I look to for inspiration are other books. Seeing how the author flows the action, how they make the characters come alive, how they draw me in, gives me fresh ideas on how to make my own writing better. So when I read and review novels, I am not just reviewing as a reader, but also as a writer. I just wanted to add that little disclaimer before I get into my next review.Sammi Ever After, the debut novel from Soma Helmi has a great plot. Sammi, a young girl in her twenties, finds a friend from childhood and instantly falls in love, preparing to move across the world just to be with him. It's her fairy tale come true. Until she arrives at the airport only to find out she has been dumped- over an email. Fairy tale broken. When Sammi finally forces herself off her friend's couch and secures a job and new friends, she decides to take a little journey to try to search for that fairy tale ending. From London to Bali to Greece, Sammi gets tangled in sticky situations and personal revelations, and realizes that her Prince Charming may have been by her side the entire time.Like I said, I think the plot is fantastic. A great story about self-discovery and love, and I am a huge travel geek, so reading about all these destinations I hope to visit had me amped to read this story. But once I started, the writing fell flat to me. Helmi relied on flashbacks and back story when introducing characters, much that was simply not needed and unnecessary to the story. For each flashback, I felt myself became less engaged in the action. Another problem I had was the dialogue didn't seem very realistic. I don't know anyone who would actually describe someone's look aloud by saying ""His sandy blonde hair and piercing blue eyes and the way his muscles ripple..."" That could be the thoughts of someone, but for a person (especially a young girl) to describe someone else that way? It just wasn't believable for me. So as much as I would have liked this plot and the characters that came along for the ride, I do not feel the writing did the story justice.","11 9, 2010",A23MYUKGYZZA8R,"Samantha J ""Chick Lit Plus""",Sammi Ever After,1289260800

Now I'm an anti-Harry Potter sort of person, so when I saw an amulet was involved I was a little wary. I also come from a completely different writing culture. I needn't have worried!  William has the gift of writing , well what I'd call young adults stories, though anyone could read this and be blessed. He has that knack which pulls you into the perspective of Brian, and tells the tale from a child of his age's point of view. The whole text has for me that wonderful fairytale feeling that I love in the Elizabeth Goudge stories such as the Little White Horse.Brian is maybe old for his age due to the abuse he has suffered in his life but he also acts just like a teenager.  His journey to find the Living water is has great narrative tension and I'm glad that it went on long enough after the climax to make the ending balanced and it sort of ties in to the supernatural of the story.I began thinking, ok, so this is a magical story in many ways, just how would this appeal to any teenager?  Its adventure with a twist of romance, reality and excitement. Yet as a Christian, how is this tale justified. (see my standpoint above).  Of course William related this to the Native Americans, and has a bible verse. Then it hit me, maybe I'm being dense, and William  had this in mind but the whole book is one huge allegory or metaphor.  Come to me and drink the streams of living water (John 4, v 13-14) . As Christians, we all seek and drink the living water of Christ and our lives should then reflect and bless all around them. This is what Brian and Rachel did with their lives. It gives you the gospel message that through Christ we can be all things and bless others.  This book does it in a way acceptable to the teenage mind if they can see it!

173,18014,B003N3V61S,"[6, 9]",2,"There's certain (sub-)genres I go into with high expectations. I have questions and I want answers. I want a specific thing told to me about what the genre is, it has to be believable, I want to be convinced on certain things but above that I want to be made to understand and believe them. Unfortunately, m&eacute;nages are at the top of that list. I need the story sold to me, to have it believable but it has to suck me in right from the beginning or there's no hope of redemption. That's a bit harsh, I know, and I'm sorry, but it's the way I feel with m&eacute;nages.With that said, this book frustrated me beyond belief. It didn't start off on a good note for me. The first 50% of the book is essentially just smut and for someone like me who prefers at least double the plot than smut, it was unbearable to get through. I was extremely close to calling this my first DNF but I agreed to stick it out until the half-way mark... Thankfully, the book finally caught my eye around that time (although it could have also been from the fact I cheated and skipped to certain parts of the book to see if I was actually wasting my time or not).Now, just to clarify, I'd say this book is made up of about 60-70% smut. Which I hated and resulted in me skipping those scenes. They were redundant, boring and unnecessary. Only a select few actually contributed to the story. The rest of it seemed like a page filler to me.It was hard for me to connect with the three MCs. For one, Luke, which is the only pov we get (in first person) is never actually described. So, I have no idea what he looks like and if he was described then I completely missed that because I don't remember any description about him regarding his appearances besides a reference to his father. Richard and Matthew, the other MCs, are perfectly described. But the thing is none of them know anything about each other. Like nothing. At ALL. They jumped into bed together at a club. Three times. Agree to go on a date. Still know nothing about each other. Then move in together. Still not knowing anything about each other. I didn't like it. Especially with the fact Luke didn't want to put Matthew or Richard into a situation of possibly getting hurt by his father but he still moved in with them when he knew his father would eventually find him and seek to make their lives a living hell. Yeah.....Anyway, so, yeah. I was frustrated throughout most of the book. To me, the relationship wasn't believable. I still don't understand their relationship. Yeah, at the end, you can tell they loved each other but it was made impossible for me to love them because there was no dialogue between them getting to know each other. What we know of them is what Luke gave us in brief summaries of what he learned from their 'dates'. Well, I wanted to actually experience those dates. Instead, I got the smexing after the date.Needless to say, I didn't much like this book. I couldn't connect with the characters or their relationship, the smexing put me off so much from the start there was barely a chance of redemption for this story. With that said, I did appreciate Sloan Parker's writing. It drew me in when the smut didn't overpower the pages. That's what captured my attention and made me want to keep reading when all I wanted to do was complain about the book. I was ready to give up on it but then the smexing lessened slightly and her words drew me in. The conflict revolving around Luke's father was a bit cliched and unbelievable but it still made me stick with the story.Overall, I'm sorry, I can't recommend this book. I never connected with the characters. I still feel as if they don't really know each other and none of it was believable to me.","01 17, 2012",A17H3ZRZKKWQJH,Nikyta,A lot of potential but fell flat,1326758400

Now her childhood big-bad-wolf-nightmares are turning into real life adult fantasies. Is sexy businessman Gray Lupo the answer to her problems, or just a wolf in gentleman's Armani?Who said being eaten by the big bad wolf was a bad thing?Alison Paige has taken Little Red Riding Hood and given it an erotic and amusing twist.  With a strong heroine, a hot older Hero in denial, a spunky Granny, along with a cast of enjoyable characters, Alison really delivers a fun erotic read.  The love scenes were steamy, though some may find a few elements of certain scenes not their style.The fact that the werewolves in this story were much more primal and true to a wolf's nature was refreshing.  However, having said that, I do have to bring to light a couple of cons.  One, I think the story could've lost a couple of side stories which felt like it slowed the story down.  Two, with some of the side stories and elements, there wasn't a true resolution.  Three, Gray Lupo is the Alpha, but the pack/family didn't really treat him as such.  There were times when the manipulation was a bit too much and too brash for the alpha persona Gray was supposed to epitomize.Overall, I would suggest this story as a weekend erotic read.  It was a fresh take on Little Red Riding Hood's story.GMTA Rating:  3.5/ 5 RavensAge Recommendation:  18+","10 29, 2011",A22BPUEYY5ZAWA,"V SaewodTice ""Saewod""",GMTA - Review,1319846400
317,1587,B001892DIO,"[1, 1]",5,"One thing you could say of T.A. Chase's books is that they are all very different. This one is a sexual romp (from Merriam Webster Online romp = a: high-spirited, carefree, and boisterous play b: something suggestive of such play: as (1): a light fast-paced narrative, dramatic, or musical work usually in a comic mood (2): an episode of lovemaking).Kasey is a 23 years old pro basketball player. He is only in his second year as professional player and he has no courage to openly admit that he is gay. He is out with his family and friends, but not with the public opinion. Plus his twin brother Garrett, a famous actor, has made coming out some years ago and now all media are only waiting for him to make the same claim.But Kasey till now has never had a boyfriend to care and he doesn't see the reason to suffer all the harrassment he will receive in the locker room if he makes that claim. That is, but now in Kasey's life enters Gram, a night club owner and an openly gay man who had bad experiences in the past with closeted lovers.Kasey must decide if he is willing to risk his career to keep his lover by his side.The story is not very long, less than 90 pages, but it's very erotic. From the first time Kasey and Gram have a very intense relationship and they are driven by lust most of the time. Since Kasey is a 23 years old guy that for sometime was deprived of a sexual partner, I think it's not strange that now that he can have someone near him, he is in frenzy to make up for the lost time. Plus it was a true discovery that Kasey is a totally bottom. I'm used to sports characters to be always very manly, even if gay, and usually they are totally top. Instead Kasey wants to be mastered, even if he is a pushy bottom.The main characters don't interact a lot with the supporting characters, but there are some interesting figures: Garrett, Kasey's brother, Paul, Kasey's teammate, but also Bo, Gram's employee and Colville, another pro basketball player. Since this is the first book in a series, I think we will have the chance to read something on one or plus of these characters.","04 25, 2008",A1E481YU3ZPK6S,Elisa,Out of Bounds (Love of Sports 1) by T.A.

The steps Belle takes once she gets to the Pack lodge to take her place as Luna are hilarious. The passage at the beginning of the book, with Belle and Rick texting each other is an imaginative use of technology and a great piece of comic relief. Belle continues to handle things with grace, humor and just a little bit of underhandedness. Do Belle and Rick get their happily ever after? Will Rick ever get the air horn away from Belle? Pick up a copy of Steel Beauty to find those answers.Dana Marie Bell writes such believable characters, and I became lost in the world of the Poconos Wolves and the Halle Pumas. I wonder if anyone else would have dared to pair an Alpha wolf and a Puma as life mates.

It didn't make any difference that he was a rich, handsome sex god because his character was hard to take. Charlie was an innocent 18 year old who was quickly falling for him. She had lied to Riccardo and said she was 24, so he had no problem taking her virtue. Riccardo leaves his vineyard where he and Charlie were involved for a few weeks. He never told her that he was actually the owner of the place and when he leaves on the pretense of visiting his mother Charlie follows. At this point, she doesn't know she's pregnant with his child but when she arrives at his mothers palatial home both Riccardo and his mother treat her like trash, and she leaves. 8 years later she has to show a large estate to a client and guess who? It's Riccardo and she takes one look and passes out. That was disappointing because for someone who's been playing the radio loudly in the car for the last eight years of her life to block out the memories of Riccardo you would think she would have been thinking what she would do if she ever ran into him again. So she wakes up and yes she tortures the hell out of him but not nearly enough for the pain, he and his mother cost her. However, even with her having somewhat of a back bone and Riccardo being a block head the story and the book were extremely good and just to see Riccardo eat crow at the end was worth the price of the book. I recommend it highly.","11 24, 2009",A2EI4VOT1F8V62,"A Romance Junkie ""Mady""",A Romance Junkie,1259020800

After that, she set out to prove him wrong by propositioning him and his best friend to have a fling with her.Garrett was shocked, but he agreed because he wanted to be with her any way possible.

She likes having sex with all sorts of people in all sorts of situations, yet she's worried about people thinking she's a slut (her direct quote).  She flips out at Eric when she thinks he's going to ask for a deeper commitment beyond the sex they've been having, but she doesn't have any issues at all in the span of a couple of days agreeing to be in a permanent menage relationship.I know this is more of a short story/novella, but the total lack of meaningful descriptons and character development is ridiculous.  All we know about Eric is that he's horny all the time; Jett is pretty much someone's wishful thinking - a male model who also happens to be brilliant and in his residency stage of medical school; Abby is in a state of unending PMS but she pretty much thinks anything or anybody having sex is ""hot.""

Lissa Matthew's came out with a book called Masked and mentioned on her blog that one of the main characters, Thor, was in this book. So after I finished Masked, I pulled this book out of the archives to read it once again.Aidn is a much sought after Dominant in a local club called Abyss. After a traumatic split with a submissive years ago, he only takes on trainees and one-night submissives. But he has come to realize he is bored with the same things and vanilla just isn't for him any more. Unfortunately, he has a hard time reconciling this with himself.Bailey is coming into her own. After not being able to work out her marriage, she has divorced and started her own bakery business. She knows Aidn from causal meetings at the Abyss, but never thought of him seriously knowing his reputation. When he approaches her outside of the lotion shop she can't believe he wants to have sex with her. She is comfortable with herself, but she knows not everyone is into larger women.They have a steamy afternoon in her place above the bakery. From the counter-top to the bed, they both believe this is just a one time affair, but Aidn gets the feeling she is the submissive for him and runs in fear. This is the theme for the story. She is ready to accept her submissive side and knows Aidn is the one, but Aidn can't let go of the past and continues to leave her several times during the course of this novella.While I understood why he had a hard time with what happened with his ex, it is no different from someone who gets a divorce. Eventually you have to get back up and if it falls in  your lap, you deal with it. He always seemed to be running and using Bailey and he knew it. I liked his character though. He struggled and eventually realized he needed to let go of the past. Bailey...I adore this woman and I want her frosting recipe. I can just imagine sitting down and eating a whole bowl of it. It's a dream of mine to own a bakery like hers...but it is only a dream for me since I can't make anything but a standard store-bought cake. That's just another reason I love this book.

Instead of clearly setting forth book marketing tips, it basically listed a slew of marketing information that can be found easily on the internet.

The beginning starts off well introducing both Ashley (heroine) and Christian (hero) and setting them amidst a ghostly atmoshphere (hah!) in an old, worn down pub.  I thought the two had immediate chemistry--always a good thing.---SPOILER ALERT----What turned me off about this book (among other things) is the heroine's constant incredulity.  I mean, she can see ghosts for gods sake, one would think the idea of angels, demons, vamps, witches, and werewolves wouldn't come as much of a shock to her. But, alas, she is constantly surprised and even more willing to deny the existance of everything around her.  Annoying.The other thing that drove me absolutely nuts was the author's insistance on keeping Ashley in the dark about EVERYTHING--what she was (a seer apparantly?), who her dad was, where her dad was, what was lurking in her basement, what Christian was, where her ghosts were going...the list goes on.  And even more maddening was the fact that Ashley never pressed the issue--it was like she was fine with being completely oblivious.I understand the appeal of mystery, but don't whack your reader over the head with it constantly. It literally took the whole book for Ashley to figure out what was going on, where the problem could have easily been solved had she TALKED to someone, forced Christian to speak up.  Unfortunately, this ticked me off to the point where the whole book became frustrating to read.The one redeeming part was the character Devon...I really liked him and I believe his story will be told next?

I'll admit right now that I'm not a big fan of hitman novels, but the character of hitman Frank Jolino was so finely drawn that I was hooked within the first few pages.I'd love to see Jolino in other books because he was intelligent, articulate, droll, and at ease in his own skin. He also surprised me because he had a moral compass. Add all that to the fact that he was a vintage mystery reader, and you get a guy who is complex, appealing, and likable. Oh, yeah, he kills people for a living, but they're by no means innocents undeserving of being whacked, but Merz lets the reader draw that conclusion. He doesn't state the obvious and then hammer it home.Less likable is Ernst Stahl, once an idealist radical and now a jaded assassin, despite constant reminders from Stahl's character that he was completing a job only to save his son. His moral compass is stuck on ""anything goes in the name of paternal love.""When the two end up in some odd paranormal mutual awareness of each other, it's interesting albeit rather unbelievable, but the compelling character of Frank Jolino keeps the reader turning the pages. You probably won't suspend disbelief, but you'll be compelled to keep reading. You'll also be rooting for Frank to figure a way out of the mess and to, somehow, end up with the babe who has some surprises of her own.WarningI downloaded the book in February, and there are numerous ""glitches"" in the book.

This book ""A Forest Apart"" wasn't on par with his other works.  It wasn't without it's charm, but it had things in it that I didn't like.The story itself is pretty simple.  It's a coming of age story for Chewbacca's son, and instead of coming of age on Kashyyyk, he is growing up on Coruscant.  It's not horrible, and we find out that Lumpy is an avid gamer and enjoys playing video games and that he idolizes his father.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***First of all, why is Han Solo on the cover?  He's not even IN this story other than a few mentions of his name.  Why not have Chewbacca and Lumpy instead of Han and Chewie?  Also, I HATE books where Chewbacca's grunts and growls are translated.  Like in the Black Fleet Trilogy, he had his speech translated and it was just stupid.  I feel that he works much better as a strong silent type who speaks through his actions rather than his words.  I mean imagine in characters like Jason Vorhees, Michael Meyers, Silent Bob, or Sphynx (from Gone in 60 Seconds), all just started having lengthy conversations throughout their movies?  They lose some of what makes those characters awesome.  Sometimes an author can say very much by having a character say very little.My only other problem with the book is when Chewie and Malla have the droid ""IT"" in their blaster sights, his back is to them and he doesn't see them.  Why don't they just shoot him?  Instead they send Lumpy out as a ""distraction.""  Yet he doesn't really do anything worth mentioning to distract IT and his minions.  He walks out on the observation deck where they are hiding, opens the window and drops down to the level where IT and his minions are loading nerve gas onto transport ships.  I mean that's not much of a distraction, besides the point of a distraction is to get someone's attention away from one spot so you can do something while they are not looking.  Well, IT wasn't looking in your direction to begin with, so why bother?  They could have just taken up positions on the observation deck and shot him.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***Okay so this story wasn't really bad other than a few minor details I didn't like.  I did like seeing that even in a galaxy far far away that we have sons who want to be like their fathers and get into trouble when they do rebellious things.  This story reminded me of what a good writer Troy Denning is and it reminded me to add his other works to my wishlist.Check this one out!","04 7, 2013",A12LKEM543ILBK,zombie phreak,A Good Quick Read,1365292800

Paul has a brain that many would love to control and while he likes working for the military, he missed Jo every day these last six years.  When a report shows that Jo has been found and is a target, Paul demands to get back all he lost.When Jo and Paul meet again, the fireworks are many and pointed.  Jo is hurt and angry that she was lead to believe Paul was dead.  Paul wants to begin again, but first he has to convince Jo to both forgive him and to understand.  Love brought them together and drove them apart. Now when the danger to Jo seems to follow her, will love be enough to give Paul and Jo another chance?Still Mine has several of my favorite aspects in a story: hot sexy scenes, engaging main characters, and enough suspense that it makes you want to read quickly to find out the ending.  Jo has grown up and found a career even while loving the husband she believes is dead.  Paul made a decision he thought would save Jo from danger and was given a second chance.  From the moment they met face-to-face, I was drawn in and could not flip the pages fast enough.  Even before giving in to their passion, I could feel the strength of it.  I was quickly reminded that the emotions that give passion can produce equal fear and anger.  Watching Jo and Paul try and work out the past to hopefully lead to a new future for them showed me that a true and deep love never really dies.  When the danger comes from an unexpected angle, at least for me, I loved seeing the depth of the trust that had been restored between Paul and Jo.  Still Mine is equal parts hot romance and suspense, which I found not to be missed.

Caleb McCurdy has just been released from a five year stint in a Yuma prison. He'd taken the fall for his outlaw brothers who'd tried to rob the bank and left him holding the horses. He'd paid for his participation, but his soul is tormented by the deeds of his brothers at the Shafton Ranch. Caleb owed a debt to the widow Shafton for the killing of her husband, something he had tried to stop. Laura Shafton remembers that evil day five years before in her nightmares. She'd lost her husband but she had her son, Robbie; the unborn child she'd been carrying. She's wary of strangers, so when Caleb knocks on her door to offer work for food, she greets him with a shotgun. While Caleb is mending her gate, Robbie seems to disappear, only to be found hiding in a tree. On his way down the boy falls breaking his arm, and Caleb helps Laura set the break and splint it. This builds a certain amount of wary trust in Laura and she allows Caleb to stay in her tool shed and continue to work for food. Caleb fears that at any time Laura's going to recognize him as the 17 year old who had accompanied those evil men, but he's matured a lot since then and his body has grown strong. Laura too is no longer the teenage bride; she's now a strong independent woman. Their attraction is something that Caleb fights; for he knows that should Laura ever find out who his is she'll never forgive him.I really liked the plot for this story. The characters are very well developed and easy to like. Though both Laura and Caleb are in their early 20's in this book, they've both lived a life time in experiences. Caleb has always been a good man, but he'd been misguided by his need for family, and so he'd stuck with his brothers. Laura is incredibly strong and resilient, almost over the top so. She'll survive anything in order to protect and care for her son. Though I found myself skipping over paragraphs because the pace seemed slow, this was a good book, one of forgiveness and healing","02 22, 2012",A1PILXSH4D277C,"KayLovesToRead ""Tell us about yourself!""","This was a good book, one of forgiveness and healing.",1329868800

4665,6285,B002JGZAT4,"[5, 5]",3,"Warning: This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating: 6/10PROS:- I love the idea of eternal love and soul mates, and very few storylines can get away with that as easily as the ""werewolf meets his mate"" one. They see each other the first time and just know that they were made for each other. (see cons below also)- The characters are cheesy and stereotypical, but I must admit to finding a guilty sort of pleasure in reading about small, victimized men who are rescued by their heroic, strapping lovers. Sasha is THE stereotype of a helpless damsel in distress like those so popular in the bodice-ripping romances of years ago. And Vadim is, of course, the perfect Alpha. Strong and imposing yet utterly selfless and kind. He's quick to anger, but only when someone's being taken advantage of or he discovers injustice in the world.- There's never a shortage of action and drama in Glenn's stories. The characters get over one hurdle, have sex, get over another hurdle, have sex, misread each other and separate, make up and have sex, and so on.- This story takes the mental communication between werewolf mates to a deeper level than I've seen in other stories. I liked not only seeing Vadim and Sasha carry on entire conversations no one else can hear, but also seeing other mated couples engaged in discussions no one else is privy to and having to guess at what they're saying based on their body language.CONS:- As much as I love stories about werewolves and their life mates, the idea that a character can meet someone and automatically be in love with him seems to me like a lazy storytelling technique sometimes. The author doesn't have to put any effort into establishing an emotional connection or building up sexual tension. It's just there. Bang. In this story, the characters have performed the mating ritual (which is basically akin to marriage, with no option of divorce) before Sasha even knows Vadim's name.- The writing tends to be shallow and repetitive sometimes. This occurs near the beginning, for example: ""The little man was his now""...and then a few paragraphs later: ""The sexy man beneath the desk was no longer theirs. He belonged to Vadim now.""- The whole book reads like a first draft that was written in about 2 weeks and then never edited. There are obvious editing errors throughout, and the story incorporates a large number of clich&eacute;s and hackneyed phrases. Some of the typos are so blatant it seems like the author didn't even read the story over before it was published, much less an editor.Overall comments: Glenn's stories have a tendency toward over-the-top drama, as is evident at the end of the first paragraph of this story: the two main guys meet and immediately recognize that they're mates, and Vadim is ""stunned!"" (I didn't add the exclamation point; it's in the book.) But I keep reading her stories, because in spite of their soap-opera feel, they're entertaining little diversions.","10 24, 2010",A3O9A7B0KJO88B,Charly T. Anchor,Silly but still likeable,1287878400

I'm glad I did. I really enjoyed this. As far as being a romance, it doesn't have much conflict in the way of the hero and heroine. In fact, there's almost none, and I found the whole light ball thing a big let down in the end. All that build up and then...nothing. I understand why she chose to do this, b/c she didn't have time to start an apocalypse, but... as a personal preference, I really hate long build ups like that that tease me and then poof, problem neatly solved in the nick of time. Just a personal preference. It's frustrating for me. lol The heroine annoyed me at first. I almost didn't make it through the first chapter, because she acted like a spoiled child, constantly pecking at at Nikos to get his attention, but I did eventually warm up to her. So if you're in the first chapter and you want to throw it agianst the preverbial wall, keep reading. It does get better.And I LOVED Nikos. I'm not usually much for the alpha male. The whole beat your chest thing is usually a huge turn off for me. But he was SEXY. During the sex scenes, she went a little over the top with the expressions for things, often describing the same feeling over and over again in very flowery, over the top language. Just not my style.But overall, I really loved the played between the hero and heroine, loved the heroine's spunky attitude, and it ended up being a very sweet and spicy romance.

I want to say the first book was either free or pretty cheap or I could have even splurged and purchased it. However it was discovered, I ended up purchasing the other two in the series because I became obsessed! I was disappointed when I had to wait for the fourth book in the series but I found out a little later that it was put on hold because of personal reasons. I hoped everything was ok and kept checking back. But imagine my surprise when I just found out recently the fourth was released in October of 2013!! And Sydney herself asked if I would like to review it. So I offered to re-read the first three and review the whole series here. So this is where we find ourselves here now, on the second day of our Sydney Somers week. (If you missed it yesterday, we had an exclusive cover reveal for a novella prequel to her Pendragon Gargoyles series. I even had the privilege of designing it!!!) So enough about my babble and let's get to the good stuff. :)We are immediately pulled into the story with Kennedy, who is the bartender at Pendragon's which is owned by Tristan and his siblings, threatening to hose down (with the water sprayer behind the bar) the hot to trot Tristan and another patron who were on the way to getting into a fight. I immediately thought, &lt;em>well this is going to be good&lt;/em>. I could tell immediately, even through Kennedy's POV, that Tristan is an alpha from the jump so the hose thing took some lady balls on her part. But this event essentially kicked off the madness and heart pounding events of the story. Kennedy is sucked into the enchanting world of paranormal beings she had no clue existed. And she finds that she can no longer ignore the powerful draw she feels towards the mysterious Tristan. But there is danger that is lurking in the shadows, hanging the threat of death over her head. Talk about a downer.But Tristan is there to do anything he can to keep her safe. Including giving up his chance to unfreeze his brother from his constant gargoyle state. Throw in a bunch of action and some hot lovin', and you've got one guy I totally want at my back...and front. ;) I love a good alpha male but I also love when they are all,&#34;do what I say now woman!&#34; and then the next it's, &#34;you are everything to me.&#34; It's enough to turn me to mush in a hot second. I loved how protective he is of Kennedy. And one part of the story had my heart aching for him and wanting to take all his hurts away. I was rooting hard for the two of them! And I was so happy with the outcome!This story has a ton of action and I loved how the tale of King Arthur and Merlin. My inner history nerd was having a field day with this new spin.
